Given: Wired network nodes can detect collisions occurring on the wire. Wireless stations cannot detect collisions on the wireless medium. What mechanism is used in wireless LANs to overcome the inability to detect collisions?
a:Antenna diversity|b:Acknowledgement frames|c:Frame fragmentation|d:Station polling|e:QoS service classes|x:I don't know
b
Every data frame, whether fragmented or not, is acknowledged by the receiver with an acknowledgement frame. Some management frames are also acknowledged. Since radios are half-duplex (meaning they can either receive or transmit, but not both simultaneously), they cannot hear a collision with the frame they are transmitting. If an ACK frame is not received within a particular time period, the STA will assume that there has been a collision and retransmit the appropriate frame.Antenna diversity is used to offset the negative effects of multipath. Frame fragmentation is used to decrease retransmissions in a noisy RF environment. Station polling happens only in PCF or HCF modes, and is unrelated to collision detection.
