You manage a wireless network that services 320 wireless users. Your facility requires 40 access points, and you have installed an 802.11-compliant implementation of 802.1X/LEAP with AES-CCMP as an authentication and encryption solution. In this configuration, the wireless network is not initially susceptible to what type of attacks?  (Choose 2)

When using LEAP, encryption cracking is not initially an issue because the keys are not exposed directly by LEAP weaknesses. LEAP weaknesses expose the user credentials such that the username and password can be acquired. This can provide network access, but does not necessarily provide the ability to decrypt user data on the WLAN. It is also not initially susceptible to L3 peer-to-peer attacks for the same reason, because it is not initially vulnerable to decryption. Still, LEAP should not be used today given more secure alternatives.
