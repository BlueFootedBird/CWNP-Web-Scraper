Complete the sentence by choosing the answers that correctly fill in the blanks.Multipath can be caused by ________ and can cause ________ effects on an 802.11 wireless LAN?
a:Trees - Signal absorption|b:Steel beams - Signal corruption|c:Clear glass - Signal nullification|d:Metal blinds - Signal purification|e:Long hallway - Signal polarization|x:I don't know
b
Steel and metal construction materials reflect RF signals. RF signal reflection causes multipath. Multipath is a situation arising from the direct-path signal combining with one or more reflected signals at the receiver. Multipath can cause signal corruption, decreased or increased signal amplitude, or nulling (complete loss of signal), especially in 802.11a/b/g networks. MIMO technology, implemented with 802.11n, takes advantage of multipath by combining reflected signals into a composite signal. MIMO thrives in multipath-rich RF environments. Trees may block RF signals, but do not typically reflect them. RF signals pass through and are attenuated by clear glass. Metal blinds may reflect RF signals, but multipath typically does not cause an improvement of the RF signal.
