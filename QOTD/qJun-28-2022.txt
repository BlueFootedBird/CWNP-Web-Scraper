After an initial meeting with a customer, the IT team leader discusses with you the utility of performing a site survey of the existing WLAN. They have APs deployed already, on channels 1, 6, and 11. What survey configuration and purpose are valid for a passive site survey in this scenario?
a:Set the client transmit power level to Max. Set the scanned channels to all channels on which corporate APs are set (1, 6, 11). Slowly walk through the entire facility. The purpose is to detect rogue APs.|b:Set the transmit power of all deployed APs to minimum. Set the client transmit power to minimum. Walk the entire facility, one time per configured channel, to establish the AP RSSI for each channel. The purpose is to determine coverage holes and interference.|c:Install a new AP for the survey and set the new AP’s transmit power to maximum. Associate the site survey client to the surveyed AP SSID. Walk the facility to determine the edge of the surveyed AP’s coverage area. The purpose is to analyze the coverage footprint and the RF impact of the already deployed APs on the new AP’s cell.|d:Ignore the client power settings. Set the survey software to scan all channels. Slowly walk through the entire facility. The purpose is to detect and identify all existing 802.11 devices on a floor plan.|x:I don't know

An infrastructure or ad-hoc rogue can be on any channel, so you would need to scan all channels to detect them, regardless of what type you are trying to locate. The purpose of a site survey of an existing deployment is often to collect the signal coming from all detected 802.11 devices, on all scanned channels. In a passive survey, the client is not transmitting, but only receiving. Therefore the client transmit power does not play any role in passive surveys. Receive sensitivity could play a role.
