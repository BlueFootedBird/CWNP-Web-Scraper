ABC Hospital has hundreds of wheelchairs, beds, COWs, and other mobile assets that are often scattered around the facility. They want to be able to accurately track each mobile asset in real-time using their Wi-Fi infrastructure, which consists of redundant WLAN controllers and 100 controller-based APs.
What steps are required for implementing real-time location tracking over the existing WLAN with active RFID tags?

Verifying RF coverage throughout the facility is the first step to implementing a real-time Wi-Fi tracking system. A location-tracking system must be implemented—whether as a software-only solution or an appliance. After Wi-Fi RFID tags are placed on all objects that need to be tracked and their information entered into the tracking system (identifying the object or person to which the tag is connected), RF fingerprinting should be performed throughout the facility. RF fingerprinting is a process by which the location-tracking system understands the RF environment and RF signature (at any place within the facility) of any Wi-Fi node on the network. Though RF fingerprinting is a more reliable method, RF triangulation or TDoA may also be used if the infrastructure product’s support these features. In either case, a post-deployment survey should validate that the desired location resolution is achieved with the technical solution in place.
