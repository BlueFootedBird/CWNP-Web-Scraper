Under what condition would the use of 802.11 frame fragmentation be most likely to increase WLAN throughput?
a:In an 802.11a network, when airtime utilization is low on the channel and there are no neighboring APs|b:In an 802.11n network, when both A-MSDU and A-MPDU are supported simultaneously|c:In an 802.11b network, when multipath and intermittent RF interference are causing corruption at the receiver|d:When several 802.11b clients are present in a 2.4 GHz 802.11n BSS using 40 MHz channels|e:When 802.11 power save is in use and the “More Data” flag is enabled on the AP|x:I don't know

802.11 frame fragmentation is used to decrease the size of frames transmitted on the wireless medium. In some environments, this could increase throughput by decreasing collisions and retransmissions. Large frames have a high probability of corruption when there is RF interference in the immediate area around the transmitter and/or receiver. By making the frames smaller, each frame has a greater chance of being properly received and acknowledged. In most modern 802.11n networks, fragmentation is being used less and less. In some legacy networks with high utilization, many slower client devices (using low data rates, such as with 802.11b), and many large frames, fragmentation may still be helpful. With MIMO and 802.11n, the opposite trend is becoming more common; that is, frame aggregation (A-MPDU and A-MSDU). To improve efficiency and reduce frame overhead, multiple MPDUs or MSDUs are being aggregated into a single frame. In an area with high interference, it is important that aggregated frames utilize the high data rates to avoid collisions.To a lesser extent than 802.11n with MIMO, 802.11a/g with radio diversity usually removes the need for frame fragmentation as well. OFDM modulation uses error correction techniques that are more resilient to interference than DSSS or HR/DSSS. With data rates up to 54 Mbps, 802.11a/g stations rarely benefit from fragmentation.
