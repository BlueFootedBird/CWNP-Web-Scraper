What is the primary difference between EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS authentication?
a:EAP-TTLS provides strong client authentication and EAP-TLS does not|b:EAP-TLS is an authentication protocol, and EAP-TTLS is an encryption type|c:EAP-TTLS provides support for legacy client authentication methods, and EAP-TLS requires certificates for client-side authentication|d:EAP-TLS uses a RADIUS server for authentication, and EAP-TTLS can only use Kerberos|e:EAP-TLS uses IP-based authentication, and EAP-TTLS uses MAC-based authentication|x:I don't know

The primary differences between EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS are:1) EAP-TTLS provides support for legacy client authentication methods (usernames/password protocols such as PAP, MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, etc.) and EAP-TLS supports only use of client-side certificates for client authentication.2) EAP-TTLS provides an encrypted tunnel between the client and server so that the client can securely pass its credentials to the server. The extra 'T' in EAP-TTLS stands for 'Tunneled'. EAP-TTLS is an enhancement of EAP-TLS and provides the same networking function.
