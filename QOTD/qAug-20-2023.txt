A credential provides a means of user or computer identification, and the solution used should be proportional to your security requirements based upon a risk assessment. Common credential types include username and password, certificates, privilege attribute certificates (PACs), biometrics, and tokens.LDAP is a standard credential access method. WEP keys are used to encrypt data or part of the shared-key authentication handshake.
