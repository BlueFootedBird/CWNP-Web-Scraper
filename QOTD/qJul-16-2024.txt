As a consultant, you are deploying a dense 802.11a network in a hospital. After extensive testing, you’ve recently deployed a test network in one part of the facility. Your customer requirements were that all 802.11a channels be used to avoid co-channel interference in this dense network. The network engineer at the hospital emails you with a screenshot of the WLAN configuration, as shown in the exhibit, and asks why channel 165 was not checked. What best practice design principle would have led you to disable support for channel 165?
a:This screenshot was taken from the test network, so all channels were not needed. Channel 165 should always be supported in dense deployments.|b:Channel 165 was disabled because it is affected in most parts of the world by 802.11h restrictions.|c:In this configuration setup, the WLAN system dynamically enables or disables supported channels whenever co-channel interference occurs and more channels are needed.|d:Channel 165 is not part of the 802.11a-supported bands and should never be used in indoor deployments.|e:Channel 165 is not part of the unlicensed OFDM frequency range. An operator’s license is required to use this channel.|f:Channel 165 may not be supported by all 802.11a/n client devices. Enabling channel 165 when some clients don’t support it may create a coverage gap for those clients.|x:I don't know

Channels 149 to 161 are part of the UNII-3 band (5.725-5.825), specified for 802.11a. There is also an ISM band that spans from channel 149 to 165 (5.725-5.875). Although this channel is not as widely known as the UNII bands and channels, most infrastructure vendors support it. Many client device vendors also support it, but not all of them do. It is important to verify that all clients support this channel before it is enabled. If some clients don’t support it, coverage gaps may result for those clients.
