MDM systems commonly support the following capabilities: *Registration* is the process used to grant access to the network for a mobile device and to provision that device for proper use on the network. Resistration is also called enrollment and may be performed in different ways, including: Pre-registration: The device is manually registered with the MDM solution before deployment to the user. This method is used for organization-owned devices. Onboarding: The devices is registered with the MDM solution through interactions between the device and the MDM server with possible involvement of user decisions. This method is used for both organization-owned devices and user-owned devices. *Profile management* is the process of creating and administering profiles. An MDM profile is a collection of settings to be applied to specific mobile device types or specific mobile devices. These settings include device restrictions, e-mail settings, VPN settings, LDAP directory service settings and Wi-Fi settings. The administrator must create the profiles and understand how they are assigned to a device for installation within a given MDM solution. *Over-the-air (OTA) management* provides the ability to send application updates, OS updates, configuration changes and profile changes without requiring a wired synchronization. For example, it is common to require that a certificate be placed on the device for some EAP types (such as EAP-TLS). This certificate may be provisioned OTA instead of requiring pre-staging. Therefore, OTA management can begin at the registration point and continue through the life of the device. OTA may be provided through the Wi-Fi network and it may be provided through push services when not connected to the WLAN. Push services are provided through APIs for IOS, Android and Windows devices. With push services, updates may be transmitted to devices even when they are not connected to the enterprise networks. Additionally, tasks such as device wipes may be performed. Device wipes usually fall into one of two categories: Enterprise Wipe: Only enterprise settings, files and apps are removed. Device Wipe: The entire device is reset to the factory defaults and all private data is removed. *Application management* involves both provisioning and restrictions. Application provisioning is the process used to place applications onto the mobile devices. Application restrictions are used to disable entire applications, features of applications and sometimes features of the mobile OS.
