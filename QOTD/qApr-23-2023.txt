When designing a channel reuse pattern for an indoor 5 GHz OFDM WLAN, what design practices are recommended or required for the best performance? (Choose two.)
a:Place two AP cells between access points using the same channel.|b:Neighboring APs should use frequencies that are at least two channels apart.|c:Only odd channel numbers and even channel numbers should be used on adjacent APs|d:Neighbor APs should use channels from different UNII bands|e:DFS requirements in 5 GHz mandate automated OFDM channel planning|f:Since OFDM channels are non-overlapping by default, just ensure that same channels are not repeated by neighbors.|x:I don't know
a
It is recommended by most manufacturers to place at least two cells between access points using the same channel in the 5 GHz band. Additionally, adjacent APs are recommended to use channels that are separated by at least 1 other non-overlapping channel (e.g. channels 40 and 48, which are separated by channel 44). Though OFDM channels are technically non-overlapping, with the plethora of channels in 5 GHz, an ideal design would avoid directly neighboring channels since there is still some low-power interference across “non-overlapping” channels.
