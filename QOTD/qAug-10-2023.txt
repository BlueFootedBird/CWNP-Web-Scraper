What statements are true regarding Pairwise Master Keys (PMK) and Group Master Keys (GMK) that are used in IEEE 802.11 RSNAs?
a:The PTK is a type of master key used as an input to the GMK, which is used for encrypting multicast data frames.|b:The PMK is used to derive the PTK which is used to protect unicast traffic.|c:The PMK may be directly mapped from a Preshared Key (PSK).|d:The PTK is used to encrypt the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) for distribution to the 802.1X Authenticator prior to the 4-Way Handshake.|x:I don't know
b
RSNA uses the pairwise key hierarchy to protect unicast traffic and the group key hierarchy to protect broadcast and multicast traffic. Both are used to create short-lived, temporary keys to minimize a number of cryptographic attacks and strengthen the confidentiality of WLAN transmissions. The PMK (pairwise master key) is derived as part of either the 802.1X/EAP process or is directly mapped from the PSK (pre-shared key) passphrase. The pairwise keys are used to create transient keys for protecting unicast traffic. GMKs (group master keys) are similar to PMKs but are derived by the access point and securely distributed to other authorized devices. They are used to create GTKs (group temporal keys) used to protect broadcast and multicast traffic.
