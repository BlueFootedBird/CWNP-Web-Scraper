One of your customers would like to deploy a wireless network for Location-based services. Their primary concern is to be able to locate devices anywhere in the facility with the best possible accuracy, preferably within 15 feet. They also want to limit their investment to what is really needed to get their desired location accuracy, and asks you to select, among the 4 coverage models below, the one that will most likely fulfill their need.

Although the recommended model is the one using the highest number of APs, it is also the only one offering enough accuracy for location services, positioning APs at the edge of the covered area for better location, and also positioning enough APs inside the facility to provide location services everywhere. Although the walls are not taken into account in this predictive model, keep in mind that they will limit the signal level detected throughout the floor. The scale of the drawing should also help serve as a reference for the typical AP density required on a floor plan to support RTLS. This floor plan, which covers a little less than 50,000 square feet, places an AP approximately every 2000 square feet. The second most likely answer option has only 12 APs, which equates to about one AP every 4500 square feet, which is normal for a data network in relatively open space. The recommended plan gains a lot of its added AP density from placing APs around the edge of the building, which is necessary for accurate location at the customer’s desired resolution.
