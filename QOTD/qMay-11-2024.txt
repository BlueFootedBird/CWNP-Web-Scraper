You are troubleshooting a problem with a USB adapter on a laptop. When you insert the adapter, after having installed the drivers, it is not detected by the operating system and no wireless networks are shown. The adapter has been tested on another machine where it works properly. What is a practical next action to take in this scenario?
a:Reinstall the operating system on the problem laptop|b:Delete the driver from the problem laptop and use the adapter without a driver|c:Install a third-party supplicant to use the adapter in the problem laptop|d:Check the driver version in use on the working computer and ensure the same driver version is used on the problem laptop|x:I don't know
d
In cases like this, the driver can be the problem. If the version used on the problem laptop is different from that used on the working laptop, you should install the working version to see if it resolves the problem. Faulty drivers can cause problems ranging from not detecting the adapter to the adapter working, but only in one band even through it is a dual-band adapter.
