You are asked to explain the benefits of WLAN controllers. Which of the following features are usually supported by WLAN controllers? (Choose 3)
a:User-configurable BSSIDs|b:Rogue AP/Client detection|c:Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)|d:HTTPS device management|e:Layer 3 802.1Q tagging|f:Local or remote data bridging|x:I don't know
b
WLAN controllers are layer 2/3 devices. Rogue detection and mitigation are available on most WLAN controllers and controller-based AP. HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, Telnet, and SSH1/2 protocols are usually used to manage WLAN controllers. HTTPS, SSH2, and SNMPv3 are the recommended secure management methods. GLBP isn’t supported by WLAN infrastructure devices. 802.1Q tagging applies to Ethernet layer 2, not layer 3. BSSIDs are assigned according to the MAC address of an AP’s radio and is based on the vendor’s BSSID iteration process, which is not configurable. When there is only one SSID configured for an AP, the AP usually uses the base radio MAC address, but when there are multiple SSIDs on the same AP radio, the BSSID is incremented value of the hardware MAC address. Many vendors incorporate features and design practices for 802.11n and 802.11ac throughput rates, they offer the option to tunnel data centrally (through the controller) or to perform local bridging at the AP.
