The 802.11i 4-way handshake takes the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) and Group Master Key (GMK) and produces the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) and the Group Temporal Key (GTK) for data encryption. This process is used for key generation for WPA-Personal, WPA-Enterprise, WPA2-Personal, and WPA2-Enterprise. WPA- and WPA2-Enterprise use the 802.1X/EAP process to generate the PMK. WPA- and WPA2-Personal take the passphrase entered by the user, put it through the 802.11i passphrase-to-PSK mapping formula, and produce a preshared key (PSK). The PSK is used as the PMK. Once a PMK is available, the 4-way handshake can be used. For more detailed information, refer to the CWNP Learning Center, and search for 'AKM'. This whitepaper explains this process in detail.
