A transmitter that emits a 50 mW signal is connected to a cable with 3 dB loss.  If the cable is connected to an antenna with a 13 dBi gain, what is the power output at the antenna? (Please express this output in mW instead of dBm)
a:250 mW|b:300 mW|c:400 mW|d:500 mW|e:1000 mW|x:I don't know
d
Since the question is asking for the answer in milliwatts (mW), the simplest process of arriving at the answer is by starting with the mW value and using the 10s and 3s.The transmitter (such as an autonomous AP, bridge, or PC card) is emitting a 50 mW signal through a length of cable. The cable introduces 3 dB of loss, which means it will divide the transmitter power in half. +3 dB will double the power, and -3 dB will divide the power in half. Therefore, the power coming out of the cable will be 25 mW. The antenna has 13 dBi gain, and dBi is treated in the same manner as dB. Since 13 dBi can be broken down into +10 dBi and +3 dBi, we can use the 10s and 3s. +10 dBi will multiply the power by 10, and 3 dBi will multiply the power by 2. 25 mW x 10 x 2 = 500 mW. dBi refers to the gain of an antenna with respect to that of an isotropic radiator. An isotropic radiator is a theoretical device which is capable of radiating energy equally in all directions. Antenna gain can also be stated in terms of dBd which refers to the gain of an antenna with respect to a dipole antenna. The dipole antenna, in turn, can have its gain referred to that of an isotropic antenna.
