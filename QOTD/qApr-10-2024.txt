The system operating margin (SOM) is the difference between the actual received signal and the signal necessary for reliable communications. For example, if -70 is required for reliable communications and a signal is received at -54, the SOM is 16 dB. Fade margin is sometimes added to a link budget to increase the SOM. Fade margin is the padding added to the link power levels beyond what is required in the link budget; however, the SOM is the actual measurement taken when the RF signal is received. Link quality is affected by the following factors: 1. Antenna gain of the transmitter and receiver 2. Transmitter output power 3. Distance (due to Free Space Path Loss, Earth bulge, and Fresnel zone) 4. Receiver sensitivity 5. Fresnel Zone blockage 6. Cable and connector losses However, the link budget and SOM do not account for all of these factors. For example, they do not consider Fresnel zone blockage as it is assumed that the Fresnel zone is at least 60% clear and preferably 80% clear. The energy calculations must simply assume this or they will not work. Antenna gain is determined by the transmitting antenna’s ability to focus the RF energy (as compared to an isotropic radiator) and the receiving antenna’s ability to capture the RF energy at the other side of the link. All cables and connectors produce loss values which need to be taken into consideration. Long cables have a greater loss value than shorter cables with the same quality. The impendence of all the cables and connectors need to be the same [usually 50 ohms] to prevent VSWR problems. VSWR can cause loss because some of the forward power is transmitted back towards the transmitter. As the distance that the RF travels increases, the signal level received decreases dramatically. When doubling a particular distance (1 mile to 2 miles), the signal level drops by 6 dB. This is one of the reasons it is important to do link budget calculation for outdoor link. The receiver sensitivity level of -85 dBm instead of -65 dBm. The smaller the sensitivity level is in terms of dBm, the better the sensitivity. RF interference in the widest part of the Fresnel zone, but not at the transmitter or receiver should not cause problems in the link. The Fresnel zone blockage does affect the SOM, but there the Fresnel zone blockage is not factored into the SOM.
