Given: Polar antenna charts provide graphical representations of an antenna's coverage pattern. What statements best describe polar chart interpretation and usage? (Choose 2)
a:Beamwidth is typically measured at the point where power is decreased by 1/2 (-3dB)|b:Beam patterns are used to measure polarization of the electromagnetic wave|c:The Vertical beam is shown on the Azimuth chart|d:The Azimuth chart provides a top-down view of the antenna's coverage|e:Elevation and Azimuth charts are always similar when measuring omnidirectional antennas|x:I don't know
a
Typically, an antenna's beamwidth is calculated by measuring the number of degrees off-axis where the beam drops to 1/2 (by -3 dB) its strength at the zero-degree position (peak amplitude). The vertical beamwidth is measured in degrees and is perpendicular to the Earth's surface. The horizontal beamwidth is measured in degrees and is parallel to the Earth's surface.Azimuth and elevation charts are a standard way of representing an antenna's coverage pattern. The azimuth chart shows a top-down view of the antenna's coverage, while the elevation chart shows a side-view of the antenna's coverage.
