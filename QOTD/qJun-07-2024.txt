In a small business, three autonomous 802.11ac APs and 21 client devices are in use with WPA2-Personal. What statement about the WLAN security of this company is true?
a:WPA2-Personal can be cracked in less than five minutes regardless of the passphrase.|b:If a weak passphrase is used, the network will be vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks.|c:With WPA2-Personal, unlike Enterprise, although the authentication is secure the data frames are not encrypted.|d:A spectrum analyzer can be used to decrypt the management frames, but not the data frames.|x:I don't know

WPA-Personal and WPA2-Personal – though both of these methods can be secure with sufficiently strong passphrases (pre-shared key or PSK), weak passphrases may jeopardize the network security. Weak passphrases can be discovered by capturing the 4-way handshake and the use of dictionary attack software. With the intruder knowing the passphrase they have the ability to connect to the AP and potentially see user data. Additionally, sadly, many administrators actually use the same text for the PSK that they use for their own administrative account password.
