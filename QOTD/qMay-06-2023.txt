While troubleshooting a connectivity issue, you notice that RSSI values reported by two different vendors’ NIC cards in the same location provide different values.What is the most likely cause of such a difference in data?
a:The IEEE does not specify how to calculate RSSI|b:One of the cards is defective|c:One card's sensitivity threshold is set too low|d:Each card is using a different frequency|e:Multipath is causing RSSI fluctuation|x:I don't know

The 802.11-2007 standard does not specify how RSSI should be calculated, only that a vendor's hardware must be capable of reporting RSSI to the driver. This results in different implementations between vendors. Similarly, care should be taken in the interpretation of RSSI values. The fact that one system receives a signal with a higher RSSI value than that of another system from the same manufacturer does not necessarily mean that the first system has better signal quality. Among other factors, the ratio of signal to noise must also be considered.
