d
The correct answer is Maximum bandwidth of a channel. The Shannon-Hartley theorem defines the bandwidth capabilities of a channel. The formula is: C = B log2 (1 + S/N) C is the channel’s capacity in bits per second (bps). B is the channel’s bandwidth in kilohertz (kHz). S is the received signal strength and N is the noise in the environment. While the details of this formula are beyond the scope of the CWAP exam, it is important to remember that the channel capacity is dictated by three primary factors: bandwidth, signal strength, and noise or interference. For example, the bandwidth of a traditional 802.11 channel is 20 MHz or 20,000 kHz. It is important to remember that the Shannon-Hartley theorem defines the maximum rate at which a channel can be used. It also reveals that the SNR is a controlling factor regardless of the channel bandwidth. To get the highest data rates, the SNR must be high (25–40 dB). Other than improving the SNR, the only option to increase the data rate is to increase the bandwidth.
