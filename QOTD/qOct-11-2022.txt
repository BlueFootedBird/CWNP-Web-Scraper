With minimal equipment and software programs a MITM or hijacking attack can be fairly straightforward. It is important to understand what technology is used in this type of attack in order to be able to protect your network from it. One common method is to use a client device with two wireless adapters. One adapter will be used in conjunction with a software AP and the other used to connect to the authorized AP. The intruder will force the unsuspecting authorized user to connect to the software AP and will then retransmit to the authorized AP using the second wireless network adapter. The success of this process assumes the attack is performed on an open wireless network (public hotspot) or the fact that the intruder has the proper credentials to connect to a secured network. An RF signal generator (or a death attack) is used to break the current connection with the AP and a wireless NIC is used to act as a software AP. Then a DHCP server is used to provide IP addresses to the client.
