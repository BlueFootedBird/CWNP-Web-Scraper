a:There is a PoE issue on the port|b:There might be port security or MAC limiting configured on the switch port which shuts it off once it reaches a threshold|c:There might be an IP conflict with the client|d:There might be an issue with the DHCP server|x:I don't know
b
Often, port-security mechanisms and other MAC-limiting configuration options explain this type of behavior.
