Which statement accurately describes non-overlapping channels in an 802.11 Wi-Fi network?
a:802.11a Wi-Fi networks have a maximum of 3 non-overlapping channels in the 5 GHz UNII-1 band|b:802.11n Wi-Fi networks have a maximum of 3 non-overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band|c:802.11a Wi-Fi networks have a maximum of 11 non-overlapping channels in the 5 GHz UNII-2 band|d:802.11g Wi-Fi networks have a maximum of 11 non-overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band|
b
802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi networks have a maximum of 3 non-overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. There are 14 total channels in the 2.4 GHz band, but regulatory domains specify which of these channels can be used. At least 11 channels are available in every regulatory domain where the 2.4 GHz band is used for Wi-Fi. In 802.11b/g/n networks, non-overlapping channels have at least five channels of separation, which, for example, means that to maximize an 802.11b/g/n network in the North American regulatory domain, channels 1, 6, and 11 should be used. The 5 GHz bands used with 802.11a/n technology have a total of 24 non-overlapping 20 MHz channels. The 802.11n amendment also added support for 20/40 MHz channels, which bond two 20 MHz channels to improve throughput. When 20/40 MHz channels are in use, the number of non-overlapping channels decreases.
