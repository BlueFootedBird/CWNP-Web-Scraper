What channel access function, defined in 802.11-2012, uses probabalistic priority with different classes of traffic to improve QoS in WLANs?

The correct answer is EDCAF. Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function (EDCAF) uses access categories (different classes of traffic) to provide probabilistic priority to WLAN traffic. Four categories are commonly used: voice (AC_VO), video (AC_VI), best effort (AC_BE) and background (AC_BG).
