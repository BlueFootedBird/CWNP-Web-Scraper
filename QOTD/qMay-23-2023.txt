Free Space Path Loss, sometimes called 'Free Space Loss' and 'Path Loss', is a term used to describe the natural expansion (broadening) of the wave front. Think of the surface of a balloon as air is pumped into it. The rubber skin gets thinner and thinner as the balloon expands. If we consider the density of the balloon material (the amount of balloon material per square meter), we would find that the density would decrease as the balloon expands. This same effect is what happens to the RF wave front as it propagates through open space. In the case of RF, the amount of power per square meter would decrease as the RF wavefront expands. The wavefront of an RF signal from an omni-directional antenna would “spread out” over a much greater volume than that from a directional antenna, which would be more “focused”. FSPL is the greatest contributor of amplitude degradation in a link budget. All other answer options are fictitious terms that are not used in WLANs.
