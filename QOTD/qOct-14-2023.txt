What differentiates an overlay wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) from WIPS integrated into a WLAN controller?
a:Overlay WIPS is limited to accessing wireless traffic at the physical and data-link layer, while integrated WIPS has access to layers 3-7 as well.|b:Only overlay WIPS monitors the RF for attack signatures and undesirable performance issues|c:Only overlay WIPS can use dedicated wireless sensors to passively monitor traffic|d:Integrated WIPS may also be used to assist with fast/secure roaming between autonomous APs.|x:I don't know

In an overlay WIPS monitoring deployment, organizations augment their existing WLAN infrastructure with dedicated wireless sensors. These are connected to the network in a manner similar to access points. However, while access points provide client connectivity, WIPS sensors are primarily passive devices that monitor the air for signs of attack or other undesired wireless activity.In an overlay WIPS system, the WIPS vendor provides a controller in the form of a server or appliance that collects and assesses information from the WIPS sensors that is monitored by an administrator. These devices do not otherwise participate with the rest of the wireless network, and are limited to assessing traffic at the physical layer (layer 1) and the data-link layer (layer 2). This is not true for integrated WIPS that can access all OSI layers.For more information, see Joshua Wright's whitepaper: A Closer Look at Wireless Intrusion Detection: How to Benefit from a Hybrid Deployment Model.
