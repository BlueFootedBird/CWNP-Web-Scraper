The exhibit shows a portion of the spectrum analysis trace from a multi-floor office building. What is true of the RF environment shown in the exhibit?
a:A microwave oven is causing wideband interference across the entire 2.4 GHz band.|b:APs on each of the non-overlapping channels would prevent a voice-grade WLAN deployment in this environment.|c:Three APs are present in this area, typically leaving plenty of available spectrum density for a successful WLAN installation.|d:The graphic does not provide enough information to predict successful use of a WLAN on a specific channel in this RF environment.|x:I don't know

While experienced engineers may be able to identify the CCK and OFDM transmissions in this exhibit, it would be unwise to assume the status of the RF environment based on a moment-in-time glance at a real-time FFT chart. For example, though a single maximum FFT measurement is shown on each of the non-overlapping channels, it is not clear whether there are more APs in the area, if this is a typical sample of the environment, how heavily utilized these APs are, and other factors as well. To demonstrate the point that this image could be misleading, the spectrum trace from which this screenshot was taken shows that the duty cycle of the CCK transmitter on channel 6 is 100% (it is a Wi-Fi signal generator), leaving no RF “room” for additional APs on that channel. However, this duty cycle information is not displayed in the provided exhibit. The important practical point here is that experience will help you classify devices and generally make accurate assumptions, but it is not recommended to definitively conclude how the RF environment will impact the WLAN without a more thorough data set including transmit masks, amplitude, duty cycle, historical information, and more.
