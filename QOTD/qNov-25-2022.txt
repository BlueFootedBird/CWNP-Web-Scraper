Refer to the exhibit to answer the question, where each branch office employs approximately 50 users. To maximize efficiency, resiliency, administrative ease, and cost effectiveness for user and machine authentication at branch offices, what authentication setup is typically recommended?
a:Local redundant RADIUS servers and user databases|b:Local RADIUS, local user database; RADIUS and user database failover to datacenter|c:Remote redundant RADIUS servers and user databases|d:Local redundant RADIUS, remote redundant user databases|e:Remote redundant RADIUS servers, local user database. User database failover to datacenter|x:I don't know
b
In a distributed enterprise similar to the one shown in the exhibit, the typical authentication architecture is to provide local authentication services and, if possible, a local user database for users at that branch. Since it is not usually financially justifiable, or necessary, to deploy redundant authentication services at each branch, redundancy is provided by using remote services at the corporate datacenter. By using local services and keeping the WAN out of the equation when all services are functioning properly, authentication efficiency is maximized. However, resiliency is also provided. Depending upon the equipment used and the network requirements, this architecture may not be ideal in all cases, but in most cases, it is the optimal balance.
