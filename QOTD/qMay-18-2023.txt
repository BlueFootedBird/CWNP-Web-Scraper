What is one purpose of the Null Data frame?
a:To notify the AP of a change in the power management mode|b:To notify clients that the AP has no buffered data to transmit|c:Used in ad hoc mode to synchronize timing within the IBSS|d:Used as the frame body of a broadcast or multicast management or control frame|e:To support 802.11 protocol extension features, like wireless ping and ARP|x:I don't know

The Null Data frame is a Data frame subtype that allows wireless stations with nothing to transmit to complete a frame exchange. This frame subtype is most frequently used to communicate a power management mode change from active to power save, or vice versa.While a wireless station is roaming between access points, it may miss data frames intended for it. The Null Data frame may be sent by a wireless station to an access point to tell the access point it is in power save mode, indicating the access point should buffer frames for the wireless station until it is ready to receive data again. Once the station has completed the roaming process, it sends another Null Data frame to the access point notifying the access point it is now in active mode and can receive frames. The access point will then forward any buffered frames to the station. Though it does not conform to the IEEE 802.11 standard power save behavior, most client vendors also use the Power Management bit in the MAC header to request buffered frames from the AP. That is, when a station is using power save, instead of using PS-Poll frames to request buffered data, they simply switch the PM bit to 0 (not in power save mode) so that the AP will transmit all buffered traffic. Then they switch the PM bit back to 1 (in power save mode) so that the AP will continue buffering frames. This behavior is more efficient than the standardized legacy power save method with PS-Poll frames.
