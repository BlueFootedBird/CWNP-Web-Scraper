You have a lightweight AP connected to a switch port. The AP is not operating as expected, though it did work when connected to a different switch port. What should you verify on the new port?
a:Ensure it is in the proper mode|b:Ensure it is configured for port spanning|c:Ensure it is limiting communication to only APs|d:Ensure it is limiting communications to only clients|x:I don't know

The correct answer is Ensure it is in the proper mode. Some lightweight APs operate in trunk mode and others operate in access port mode. Given that the cable was moved to the port, the first thing to check when operations are not as expected is the port configuration.
