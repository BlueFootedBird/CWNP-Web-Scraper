The Wi-Fi Protected Setup specification mandates that all Wi-Fi CERTIFIED products that support Wi-Fi Protected Setup are tested and certified to include both PIN and PBC configurations in APs, and at a minimum, PIN in client devices. A Registrar, which can be located in a variety of devices, including an AP or a client, issues the credentials necessary to enroll new clients on the network. In order to enable users to add devices from multiple locations, the specification also supports having multiple Registrars on a single network. Registrar capability is mandatory in an AP. The optional NFC and USB methods, like PBC, join devices to a network without requiring the manual entry of a PIN. In NFC configuration, Wi-Fi Protected Setup is activated simply by touching the new device to the AP or another device with Registrar capability. The USB method transfers credentials via a USB flash drive (UFD). Both provide strong protection against adding an unintended device to the network. However, Wi-Fi certification for USB and NFC is not currently available.
