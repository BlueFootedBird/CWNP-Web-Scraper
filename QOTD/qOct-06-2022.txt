As the wireless network administrator for XYZ Company, you have been tasked with upgrading your company's legacy wireless network to one that supports robust security networks (RSN).  As part of the process, you recommend implementing a Transitional Security Network (TSN).What is the key benefit of this recommendation?
a:Client stations can continue to connect using WEP encryption while RSN mechanisms are implemented.|b:Legacy hardware that doesn't support AES encryption may still be used if configured for WPA|c:Clients stations may authenticate using a preshared key until a RADIUS account is established|d:Requiring the use of TKIP eliminates connections with static encryption keys|x:I don't know

The Transitional Security network (TSN) concept is used when support of pre-RSNA (robust security network associations) devices is desired. A TSN allows the ability to transition from older hardware that may only support WEP to newer RSN-supported hardware. TSN access points support simultaneous connections to both pre-RSNA and RSNA devices, whereas an RSN access point would not allow clients to associate using WEP.
