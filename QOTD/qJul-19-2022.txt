You have been asked to explain to some junior engineers some of the fundamental concepts related to WLANs.  Which of the following statements could you accurately make?
a:Beacons are frames used to organize and synchronize communication within a BSS and are only ever transmitted by APs.|b:The client station’s SSID must match the AP’s SSID, and the SSID should be different for each AP within an ESS.|c:The BSSID is typically the MAC address of an AP used as the unique identifier in a BSS, or is randomly created by the first station of an IBSS.|d:Wireless stations create an infrastructure BSS to create an ad-hoc network if there are no access points available for association.|x:I don't know
c
The BSS is identified by a 48-bit hex value called the BSS Identifier (BSSID), which is the MAC address of the access point, or is created by the first station of an independent BSS, since an IBSS doesn't use an access point. Beacons are frames used to organize and synchronize communication within the BSS or IBSS, and are used by either access points or wireless stations. Beacons contain a number of fixed fields and information elements (IEs). There are general categories of IE which may be found in beacons: Mandatory, Optional and Proprietary. Proprietary fields are vendor specific.A client must have a matching SSID to associate with an access point; however, the SSID value is consistent across an ESS.
