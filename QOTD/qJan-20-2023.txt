Even when implementing guest access using tunnels to the DMZ, certain risks exist. What risks are still associated with implementing a guest network without any advanced traffic monitoring or filtering features enabled? (Choose 2)
a:The WLAN could be used to send spam email messages.|b:Attacks against the corporate WLAN, which uses WPA2-Enterprise, could be launched from within the DMZ to acquire the PTK and GTK.|c:Internet-based attacks can still be launched using the WLAN.|d:Unless HTTP or Telnet are in use, the guest users could access the management interfaces of the APs and reconfigure them.|x:I don't know
a
Guest WLANs can nearly always be used to perform Internet attacks like spam and other Internet-based attacks. The only real protection against this is the disallow guest Internet access; however, the more common alternative is to display an acceptable use message to the guest user through the captive portal. HTTP and Telnet are not secure management protocols. The PTK and GTK cannot be acquired from the wired side with any known attacks today on modern equipment.
