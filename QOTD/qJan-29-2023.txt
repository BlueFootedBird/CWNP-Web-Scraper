Diffraction is the term used to describe the property of RF waves that allows bending around objects. The frequencies used in 802.11 WLANs have a limited ability to diffract. Refraction occurs when the RF signal passes from a medium of one density to a medium of another density. A “bending” of the wavefront occurs. Refraction can be seen in nature, when we put a stick in water. The stick appears to be bent, as a result of light refraction. Factors such as the amount of water vapor, the atmospheric pressure, and air temperature all have an effect on the degree of refraction. Scattering occurs when an RF signal is reflected off an object in multiple directions. It can occur when the RF signal meets smog in the atmosphere, a chain-link fence, or “rough” ground, for example. When we are driving through fog in a car, we can observe the scattering of the light from the vehicle’s headlights by the water particles in the air. Reflections occur when the RF signal “bounces off” a smooth surface. Not all smooth surfaces are capable of reflecting an RF signal. Examples of reflectors include metal and still water. If the surface is not smooth, scattering can occur. Depending upon a number of factors, reflections can cause multipath. When an RF link occurs over lakes, the reflective properties have to be taken into account. Whenever a link occurs over water that is tidal in nature (e.g. a harbor area), the multipath signals will be affected by the raising and lowering of water level.
