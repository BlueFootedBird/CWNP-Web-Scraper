PPTP provides a way to route PPP packets over an IP network. Since PPTP allows multiprotocol encapsulation, you can send any type of packet over the network. A common use it to send IPX packets over the Internet.While native IPSec cannot transport IPX packets, when using with L2TP in tunneling mode, or using GRE tunneling, it can also transport IPX packets. SSH, EAP-PEAP, and GSM are not valid options.
