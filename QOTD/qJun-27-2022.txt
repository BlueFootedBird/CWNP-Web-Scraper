What vulnerabilities are present when SSID hiding is used as a security mechanism?
a:Role Based Access Control (RBAC) cannot be enabled in Wi-Fi networks where SSID hiding is enabled.|b:A hidden SSID can often be derived by decryption software utilities when capturing frames from the wireless medium.|c:SSIDs are only required for networks using 802.1X/EAP security, which makes passphrase-secured networks vulnerable to attack.|d:SSID values cannot be removed from some frame types, which allows attackers to discover the SSID if these frames traverse the wireless medium.|x:I don't know
d
SSID values are present in Beacons, Probe Requests & Responses, Association and ReAssociation Requests, and other frames. When SSID hiding is enabled, depending on the vendor's implementation, the SSID values will be removed from Beacons and certain probe response frames. Protocol analyzers and other diagnostic software can easily see the SSID in other frames that traverse the wireless medium.
