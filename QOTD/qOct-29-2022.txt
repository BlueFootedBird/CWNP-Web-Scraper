There are several factors that affect the data rate at which two stations in a WLAN communicate. Each physical layer technology (PHY) specifies a certain set of data rates that can be supported in a BSS. For example, 802.11g and 802.11a both support 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps connections, while 802.11b supports only 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps. Of course, 802.11g supports 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 to maintain backward compatibility with 802.11b as well. However, these sets of data rates are used as possible options within a BSS depending upon environmental factors. Client and AP location as well as RF environmental factors, such as obstructions and sources of RF interference, are factors in determining the data rate used within the range provided by the PHY technology. A function known as Dynamic Rate Switching (DRS) is used by 802.11 stations to adjust the data rate according to environmental changes.
