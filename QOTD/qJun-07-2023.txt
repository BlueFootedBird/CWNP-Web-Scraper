Given: You’ve just purchased a protocol analyzer and installed the software. After loading the proper drivers and starting the application, you would like to begin wirelessly troubleshooting an EAP authentication exchange. In that interest, you care only to capture and inspect the EAP frames, the 4-way handshake, and the ACK frames. You have no need to see the discovery, 802.11 authentication, and 802.11 association.  You’ve configured a MAC address filter to include the problematic client in question, and you are now configuring the frame filter. What frames should be included in the filter for this frame trace?
a:Management frames only|b:Control frames only|c:Data frames only|d:Management and control frames|e:Data and control frames|f:Management and data frames|g:All frame types must be included|x:I don't know
e
In the scenario provided above, only data and control frames would be necessary. On the wireless network, EAP frames during the 802.1X/EAP authentication and the 4-way handshake are sent using the data frame type while ACK frames are control frames. The discovery, authentication, and association all include management frames, but those portions of the frame exchange are not to be included in our fictitious scenario. Understanding frame types and frame exchanges is very important when you are creating and applying filters to protocol analysis traces.
