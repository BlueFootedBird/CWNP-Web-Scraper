Patch antennas focus RF energy in a specific direction, usually with fairly wide vertical and horizontal beamwidths appropriate to hotels, hospitals, and other similar structures. Patch antennas are flat, and often blend into their surroundings very well. For that reason, they are often used in hotels, restaurants, and similar businesses where aesthetics are important.
