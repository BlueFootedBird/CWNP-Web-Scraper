You are troubleshooting a wireless network that is AES encrypted and hides the SSID in beacons. What unencrypted contents could you expect to see with a wireless protocol analyzer? (Choose 3)
a:802.11 management and control frames|b:MAC addresses of the wireless stations|c:The BSS’s SSID|d:IP addresses of the wireless stations|e:LLC headers|f:DHCP discovery broadcasts|x:I don't know

While many wireless protocol analyzers can interpret OSI layers 2-7 (and report minor parts of layer 1), layers 3-7 will be encrypted by 802.11 encryption schemes (unless the analyzer has been provided with a decryption key.) Only information found in layer 2 headers such as wireless management and control frames, wireless station MAC addresses, and SSID information will be seen.IP addresses are found at layer 3, and would be encrypted. In a 'closed' wireless network, the SSID information is removed from beacons, however it is still available in other layer 2 packets, such as association and reassociation requests. LLC (Logical Link Control) information is part of the Data Link layer of the OSI 7 layer model. The other sublayer of the Data Link Layer, the MAC, is one of the two layers (MAC and PHY) used in the 802.11 series of protocols. Because the LLC layer is not defined in the 802.11 standards, any LLC (or SNAP) information is considered as part of the MSDU being passed down from higher layers to the 802.11 protocol stack.DHCP is also an application protocol above Layer 2.
