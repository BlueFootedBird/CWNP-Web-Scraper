While troubleshooting a wireless connectivity issue, you suspect XYZ Company's wireless network is experiencing interference from a non-Wi-Fi network source.What tool would you use to evaluate and confirm your suspicion?
a:Protocol analyzer|b:Manual site survey software|c:Spectrum analyzer|d:Netstumbler|e:Wireless networks detector|f:Wireless oscilloscope|x:I don't know

Narrowband, all-band, RF signal degradation, and adjacent and co-channel interference are the most common sources of RF interference. To identify narrowband or other non-Wi-Fi network related interference an RF spectrum analyzer is required.Protocol analyzers will detect interference from other wireless networks, but will not see the physical-layer interference seen by an RF spectrum analyzer. Just as a prism will separate the different colors of light (which all have distinct individual frequencies) from white light, so a spectrum analyzer separates a “mixture” of frequencies into distinct bands. Spectrum analysis tools are essential for visualizing and troubleshooting the frequency spectrum where WLANs operate.
