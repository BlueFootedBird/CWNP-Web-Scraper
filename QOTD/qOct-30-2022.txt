Site surveys are used to answer how many access points are needed and where they should be located. Additionally, configuration settings such as output power and channel selection should be included. Client requirements such as throughput requirements, reliability, etc. will drive design decisions and should be noted. Today it is common to include heat map representations of RF coverage areas. Heat maps generally use different colors to represent different signal levels. The term “heat map” comes from the display produced by an infra-red thermal imaging camera, which uses different colors to represent different temperatures; e.g. red for hot and blue for cold.At the beginning of the design stages, a WLAN product will often be chosen and the surveyor should use that AP type for the survey. The surveyor would not need to include detailed configuration details or default configuration settings for the AP.
