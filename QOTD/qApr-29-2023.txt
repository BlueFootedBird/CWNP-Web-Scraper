You deployed a wireless network in an office building. The solution is a controller-based solution with APs in VLANs 7, 8 and 9 and controllers in VLAN 10. You used DHCP option 43 to provide the controller Management IP address to the access points. During the deployment verification phase, the wired network team reports that discovery packets are being transmitted by APs. Based on their observations, they wonder if there is a misconfiguration in your wireless setup.
Based on the provided information, what is the accurate answer?
a:These packets are messages from the APs, trying to discover the other APs in the same subnet, and are completely normal.|b:These packets are the controller-based APs’ way of discovering support for DHCP Option 43, and are completely normal.|c:Even when APs receive DHCP option 43, they use other packets to also discover controllers in their own subnet, so these packets are completely normal.|d:Only stranded APs resolve to use Layer 3 broadcast to discover controllers, so these packets must originate from APs that are improperly configured.|x:I don't know
c
Controller-based APs often use some combination of several techniques (including DHCP Option 43, DNS, broadcast, unicast) to discover as many controllers as they possibly can, before deciding which controller is best to join.
