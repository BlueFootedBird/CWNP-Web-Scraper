Given: The frame decode in the exhibit shows an initial 802.1X PEAP authentication. For simplicity, some of the EAP Request and EAP Response frames were hidden.  The first Action frame is an ADDBA Request and the second Action frame is a successful ADDBA Response.  In addition to the hidden EAP frames, what other frames are missing from this frame trace?
a:An ACK frame following the probe request|b:An open authentication request frame|c:All reassociation request/response frames|d:A BlockAck request and subsequent BlockAck frame|e:The first 802.1x frame of the 4-way handshake and subsequent ACK|f:The last frame of the 4-way handshake and subsequent ACK|x:I don't know
e
Four frames were hidden here: The open authentication response and ACK frame and the first frame of the 4-way handshake and ACK. You can know that authentication frame that was hidden was the response because the client always initiates the authentication and the client sends probe requests. Thus, you should be able to easily correlate the client’s MAC to the included authentication request frame. Along similar lines, since none of the frames have errors or retries, it should be easy to identify that the first frame of the 4-way handshake is missing as well, since it is initiated by the AP.
