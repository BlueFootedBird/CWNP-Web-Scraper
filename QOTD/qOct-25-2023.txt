As a support technician for a PC card manufacturer, you receive a call from a user who is having problems with his internal mini-PCIe card. The user states that he generally uses the card for Wi-Fi connectivity, but has recently attempted to use the card with a software protocol analyzer. He states that he has installed the protocol analyzer software and selected his mini-PCIe card as the adapter for use, but it will not work.  What problem is likely preventing this user’s mini-PCIe card from working properly with the protocol analyzer? (Choose 2)
a:Due to host operating system conflicts, mini-PCIe cards do not work with protocol analyzers.|b:Only external PCMCIA, USB, and PCI Express cards are compatible with protocol analyzers.|c:The user has installed the proper software, but a different driver is needed for protocol analysis.|d:The user’s Wi-Fi client utility software does not support the proper third-party APIs required by the protocol analysis software.|e:The mini-PCIe card is still being used for network connectivity, and the client supplicant has not released control of the adapter to the protocol analyzer.|x:I don't know

Many popular mini-PCIe cards can be used for both client connectivity and protocol analysis. However, this function requires a separate driver to be loaded that initiates an RF Monitor mode on the card. The driver will stop the card from functioning as a Wi-Fi client and allow it to function as a protocol analyzer. While external Wi-Fi cards are often used for protocol analysis, it is not required that the card be external to the laptop. However, when the same adapter is used for client connectivity as well as protocol analysis, the software client utility should be configured to “release” control of the adapter so that the protocol analyzer has exclusive use of it.
