In an overlay WIPS network, dedicated wireless sensors analyze wireless communications, and are typically deployed with the ability to channel scan and analyze traffic on U-NII and ISM band frequencies. This is a benefit when identifying flood attacks (DoS), etc., but not when analyzing a single channel wireless network. This is because the sensor will miss attacks on the wireless network while scanning other frequencies.
