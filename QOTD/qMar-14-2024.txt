Wi-Fi Alliance Whitepaper: 'WMM Power Save for Mobile and Portable Wi-Fi Certified Devices', Page 7. Power save behavior is negotiated during the association of a client with an access point. WMM Power Save or legacy power save is set for each WMM AC (voice, video, best effort, background) transmit queue separately. For each AC queue, the access point will transmit all the data using either WMM Power Save or legacy power save, using the WMM QoS mechanism. While clients using legacy power save need to wait for the beacon frame to initiate a data download, WMM Power Save clients can initiate the download at any time, thus allowing more frequent data transmission for applications that require them. There are two ways in which the access point may send the buffered data frames to the client. If the data belongs to a legacy power-save queue, transmission follows legacy power save. If the data belongs to a WMM Power Save queue, data frames are downloaded according to a trigger-and-delivery mechanism.
