You are troubleshooting a performance problem in a WLAN that uses a cloud-managed wireless network management system. Several users in the same remote office are reporting throughput problems consistently. The users having problems are located approximately 65-75 meters from the only 802.11ac AP at the location and several walls exist between the users and the AP. The AP has a 1 Gbps uplink connection to the switch. A total of 18 users use the WLAN. What is the more likely cause of the performance problem?
a:The 1 Gbps link to the infrastructure|b:Low data rates|c:Cloud management|d:Periodic interference|x:I don't know
b
The correct answer is Low data rates. Given that the AP is an 802.11ac AP, all stations should gain sufficient throughput when only 18 users are connected. The 1 Gbps uplink is likely to handle the traffic of 18 users very well. Periodic interference is not likely because the users experience consistently poor performance. Therefore, the most likely problem, based on the distance from the AP and the attenuation factors, is low data rates.
