The 802.11-2007 standard specifies use of 802.1X/EAP and preshared keys.WPA AND WPA2 Personal use the preshared key method, while WPA and WPA2 Enterprise use the 802.1X/EAP authentication method.. 802.1X is a port-based access control mechanism specified in a separate IEEE specification (IEEE 802.1X-2004). It is used, along with EAP, to provide flexible and secure WLAN authentication. There are many types of EAP, and the 802.11-2007 standard only specifies a generic 802.1X/EAP framework by which to authenticate clients. Most EAP types have their own RFC.When 802.1X/EAP is used, the RFC for the EAP type in use specifies how the AAA key will be exported. The AAA key is used to make the Pairwise Master Key (PMK), which is then used, during the 4-Way Handshake, to derive the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK). With Preshared keys, a passphrase is entered into the authenticator and supplicant. Both the authenticator and the supplicant perform a passphrase-to-preshared key (PSK) mapping algorithm. The PSK is equal to the PMK and the PTK is derived during the 4-Way handshake in the same way with Preshared key authentication as it is with 802.1X/EAP.WEP is a legacy encryption method used with WLANs, but it is not an authentication solution. TKIP and AES-CCMP are also encryption methods, not authentication solutions. MAC filters can be implemented to restrict traffic through the WLAN, but they are not an authentication solution, and they are not defined within the 802.11 standards.
