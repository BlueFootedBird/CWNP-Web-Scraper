You perform a physical site survey using an AP with the transmit power set to 100 mW and using 2.6 dBi antennas. When you purchase APs for the deployment, the AP used in the survey is no longer available and APs with a maximum transmit power of 50 mW and 2.2 dBi antennas are used. What is the likely outcome if the APs are implemented according to the original site survey plan?

When selecting APs for manual site survey, two factors are important: they should be the same APs you plan to implement and they should be configured, in general, as you plan for them to be configured. You want to configure an average output power, even if you plan to use RRM. For example, for a standard density deployment, you may set it to 20 or 25 mW. For a high density deployment, you may set it to 10 or 15 mW. The point is that you should survey and measure the environment with APs configured similarly to what you plan to deploy. If, for example, you survey using an AP with 100 mW output power and 2.8 dBi gain antennas, but then you implement APs with a maximum of 50 mW output power and 2.2 dBi gain antennas, the coverage will be wildly different than the survey results. In fact, many gaps in coverage are likely to exist.
