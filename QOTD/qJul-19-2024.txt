When using a VPN for connectivity from a branch office to a headquarters location, what technology can be used to improve the performance of Internet browsing and access for branch office users?

When implementing a VPN, the decision between tunneled forwarding and split tunnel forwarding must be made. In nearly all scenarios, split tunnel forwarding is best. The benefit of split tunnel is simply that all Internet traffic can pass directly out to the Internet. The negative aspect of split tunnel is that any Internet filtering that is required must be duplicated at each branch office. If the VPN link provides sufficient throughput, some organizations will choose to perform tunneled forwarding so that all Internet filtering, monitoring and reporting can be configured and managed at the headquarters location. Others will implement policy-based Internet content filtering so that the rules can be created at headquarters and then replicated to remote or branch offices without much effort.
