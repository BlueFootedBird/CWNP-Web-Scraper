Which one of the following items would not be useful to an engineer doing an indoor site survey?
a:Access to network firewall rules|b:Previous Site Survey Reports|c:Information about security restrictions for access to different areas of a facility|d:List of RF systems already in use in the facility|x:I don't know
a
Security information may be needed to do indoor site surveys in secure facilities such as government buildings and laboratories with limited access to outside individuals. Knowing some of the RF systems already in the facility will help ensure that you determine if the systems will cause interference. The 802.11 systems may be examined with a protocol analyzer while other RF systems may be examined with a spectrum analyzer. Previous site surveys reports will show the location of previously installed APs and antennas which may cause interference with the new WLAN. It may also help to troubleshoot issues in the existing WLAN that is installed. A site survey engineer should not need physical or configuration access to the network’s firewalls or firewall rules.
