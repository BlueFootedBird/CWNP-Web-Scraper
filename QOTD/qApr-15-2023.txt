The Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands are defined by the ITU-R and are reserved specifically for devices that emit radio frequency energy. These bands are unlicensed and were originally intended for purposes that are not related to communication. However, because of the unlicensed nature of these bands, communication technologies have been adopted to them, despite the fact that they may have interference sources.Some of the common ISM bands used for radio communications are 902 - 928 MHz, 2.400 - 2.500 GHz, and 5.725 - 5.875 GHz. Of the 5 GHz channels listed in the answer options, only channel 165 is part of an ISM band. UNII-1 (5.15-5.25 GHz) -- 36, 40, 44, 48 UNII-2 (5.25-5.35 GHz) -- 52, 56, 60, 64 UNII-2e (5.47-5.725 GHz) -- 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140 UNII-3 (5.725-5.825 GHz)* -- 149, 153, 157, 161 ISM 5.8 GHz -- (5.725-5.875 GHz) -- 165 (the center frequency of channel 165 is 5.825 GHz)
