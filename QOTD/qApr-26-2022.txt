The 802.11 working group is a committee of industry professionals devoted to creating vendor-neutral standards for the development of WLAN networking technologies. The 802.11 working group started with a standard called 802.11-1997. The standards are complete documents that define how the technology works. When the working group begins to develop new enhancements to the standard, they define the topic and assign it to a task group, which is designated with a letter, such as 802.11a. As the task group defines how the new enhancements will work, how they will affect the existing standard, they eventually come to an agreement and finalize the document through a voting process. At this point, the task group’s document is “ratified” and is considered an amendment to the standard. After a series of amendments, the standard is combined so as to include all amendments up to a cutoff point. For example, the original amendment included some basic functionality, but it was combined in 1999, 2003, 2007, and will again be combined as 802.11-2011.
