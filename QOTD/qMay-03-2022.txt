What term identifies the bending of an RF signal when it passes through a medium with a different density?
a:Reflection|b:Refraction|c:Scattering|d:Diffraction|
b
If you have ever half submerged a straight stick into water, you have probably noticed that the stick appears bent at the point it enters the water. This optical effect is due to refraction. As light passes from one transparent medium to another, it changes speed, and bends. The extent of this effect depends on the refractive index of the relevant mediums and the angle between the light ray and the line perpendicular to the surface separating the two mediums. Each medium has a different refractive index. A similar event happens as RF waves pass through refractive mediums; the RF wave is bent and changes directions as it passes through different refractive mediums. Refraction is sometimes confused with diffraction. However, they are two completely different propagation behaviors. With diffraction, the RF waveform “bends” around an object resulting in the waveform changing direction. In cities, this effect can cause “blind spots” for cellular telephone reception, when the cellular signal “bends” around buildings.
