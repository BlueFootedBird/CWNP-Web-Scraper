When implementing an indoor Wi-Fi mesh solution, it is important that the antennas on each AP be oriented in the same manner.  What is the term that describes this type of antenna orientation?

Because of RF wave characteristics, antennas on opposing sides of a link should be polarized (oriented) in the same manner. Failing to do so could result in signal losses as high as 20 dB (99%). Polarization is particularly important in outdoor links, indoor mesh links, and other implementations when external antennas are used.
