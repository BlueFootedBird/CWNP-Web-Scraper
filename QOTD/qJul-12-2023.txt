ABC Corporation has recently hired a skilled wireless LAN security consultant to design, configure, install, and test a wireless LAN security implementation.  The security implementation consists of 802.1X/PEAP, IPSec, and SSH2 solutions using the strongest available encryption.  The security policy is very strict about use of the software solutions, and all end users have been sufficiently trained.  When an unauthorized user tries to access the corporate WLAN from the parking lot, he cannot circumvent the existing security solutions.  What are the next two steps the unauthorized user could take in order to penetrate the system's security?
a:Perform a distributed Internet crack against a single access point|b:Perform a social engineering attack against help desk personnel|c:Perform an RF jamming attack against the WIPS|d:Mount an email virus campaign to unlock access points from the wired LAN segment|e:Place a rogue access point on ABC Corporation's network|x:I don't know
b
Due to the level of security implemented, any attack against an access point will be futile. An RF jamming attack will not penetrate the network, but rather it will deny network access to authorized users. Since the security methods implemented require usernames and passwords, a social engineering attack could be possible. By placing a rogue access point on the wired network, the wireless network can be successfully penetrated by circumventing existing security mechanisms.
