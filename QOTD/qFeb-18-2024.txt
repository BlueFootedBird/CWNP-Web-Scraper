802.11i (now a part of 802.11-2007) calls for the default use of the CCMP encryption scheme using the AES encryption algorithm. The TKIP encryption scheme using the RC4 encryption algorithm is also allowed. RC4 is also used with WEP, pre-dating 802.11i, so it is incorrect in this question. 802.1X port-based access control with Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) support and preshared keys are both specified as authentication mechanisms.Section 5.8.1 specifies use of 802.1X as follows:“IEEE 802.11 depends upon IEEE 802.1X to control the flow of MAC service data units (MSDUs) between the DS and STAs by use of the IEEE 802.1X Controlled/Uncontrolled Port model. IEEE 802.1X authentication frames are transmitted in IEEE 802.11 data frames and passed via the IEEE 802.1X Uncontrolled Port. The IEEE 802.1X Controlled Port is blocked from passing general data traffic between two STAs until an IEEE 802.1X authentication procedure completes successfully over the IEEE 802.1X Uncontrolled Port. It is the responsibility of both the Supplicant and the Authenticator to implement port blocking. Each association between a pair of STAs creates a unique pair of IEEE 802.1X Ports, and authentication takes place relative to those ports alone.”The included graphic illustrates the generic flow of EAP authentication with 802.1X port-based access control.The 4-Way handshake is used by both 802.1X/EAP and preshared key (PSK) implementations and consists of the following steps:a) The Authenticator sends an EAPOL-Key frame containing an ANonce.b) The Supplicant derives a PTK from ANonce and SNonce. c) The Supplicant sends an EAPOL-Key frame containing SNonce, the RSN information element from the (Re)Association Request frame, and a MIC. d) The Authenticator derives PTK from ANonce and SNonce and validates the MIC in the EAPOL-Key frame. e) The Authenticator sends an EAPOL-Key frame containing ANonce, the RSN information element from its Beacon or Probe Response messages, MIC, whether to install the temporal keys, and the encapsulated GTK. f) The Supplicant sends an EAPOL-Key frame to confirm that the temporal keys are installed.
