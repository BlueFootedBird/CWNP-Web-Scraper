In an 802.11 Wi-Fi network, an access point's coverage area is affected by ___________.
a:Frequency in use|b:Security protocols|c:The number of Wi-Fi users|d:Building materials|e:Client adapter drivers|f:Antenna gain|x:I don't know
a
Several variables have a direct relationship with RF propagation. Transmitted signal power, antenna gain, free space path loss (normal signal loss as the RF waves travel through the air), and RF obstructions (any object through which or around which an RF wave must travel) are the most significant factors related to signal propagation. Construction materials used in buildings have varying attenuation qualities. Some dense building materials, such as concrete, cause significant RF signal loss, while others, such as drywall or single-pane windows, have a smaller impact on RF signal propagation. Other materials, such as metal, can reflect an RF signal, allowing very little or no signal penetration. All of these factors should be considered when a Wi-Fi network is being deployed.
