You've been hired by Company XYZ to help securely connect a client\server application from the company's main office server to a wireless laptop at a branch office location.  The wireless client is connected to the network on a private IP subnet through a small branch office WLAN controller.The branch office and main office both use firewalls and NAT to protect their private networks from Internet-based attacks.  They do not have a dedicated VPN connection or private connection between them.What feature on the WLAN controller will allow the wireless client and server to communicate from the main office, through the Internet and to the private network at the branch office?

Port forwarding, or tunneling, is a way to forward otherwise insecure TCP traffic through SSH Secure Shell. You can secure for example POP3, SMTP and HTTP connections that would otherwise be insecure.There are two kinds of port forwarding: local and remote forwarding. They are also called outgoing and incoming tunnels, respectively. Local port forwarding forwards traffic coming to a local port to a specified remote port. Remote port forwarding does the opposite: it forwards traffic coming to a remote port to a specified local port.
