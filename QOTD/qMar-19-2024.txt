Which of the following is true regarding industry organizations and agencies? (Choose 2)
a:Government agencies regulate the WLAN devices' use of the RF spectrum through the creation of specific standards such as HR/DSSS, ERP, and OFDM.|b:An IEEE standard must be ratified before it can be implemented and sold in a manufacturer's product.|c:The goal of the Wi-Fi Alliance is to certify interoperability of wireless LAN products.|d:To address the weaknesses found in WEP, the IEEE introduced WPA, followed by WPA2.|e:Regulatory bodies have the ability to certify wireless systems and can determine the RF spectrum available for WLAN operation.|x:I don't know
c
The goal of the Wi-Fi Alliance is to certify interoperability of wireless LAN devices. Regulatory bodies govern the RF spectrum. Some regulatory bodies require that 802.11 enabled products be tested at a certified lab to ensure that the radio does not exceed radiation limits and cause interference with other devices operating at these frequencies. The IEEE specifies standards such as HR/DSSS (802.11b), ERP (802.11g), and OFDM (802.11a), not the FC Manufacturers often create proprietary or 'pre-standard' equipment. Examples include pre-G and pre-N access points. WPA and WPA2 are not IEEE standards, but were created by the Wi-Fi Alliance based upon IEEE standards such as 802.11i. Due to the fact that the final ratification of an IEEE standard can take a relatively long period of time, the Wi-Fi Alliance will often produce a standard which can be used by manufacturers prior to the final ratified standard being published by the IEE The standard produced by the Wi-Fi Alliance will be a “snapshot” of the final ratified standard, containing enough information for a manufacturer to be able to implement the standard’s main features. This has been done with WPA as well as 802.11n draft 2.0, for example.
