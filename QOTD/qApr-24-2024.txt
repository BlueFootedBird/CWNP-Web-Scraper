Before a wireless client can transmit data on a wireless network, it must join the network by completing the association exchange with the AP. Authentication always occurs before association. When using Open System authentication, the authentication process will always succeed but must still occur before the association process can begin. A WLAN client in a single access point system would not have to disassociate before associating with the access point. MAC filters are not required in a wireless system.The client must also discover the SSID or be manually configured with the SSID prior to joining the BSS. The SSID is a mandatory field in the association request frame.
