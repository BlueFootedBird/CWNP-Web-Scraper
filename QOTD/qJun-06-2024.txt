Use the graphic as a reference. You are asked to deploy a mesh network. During your site survey, you tested the link between the farther AP on the left (P#4271) and the mesh portal AP highlighted with the blue arrow. The green and yellow lines show the expected backhaul links from the portal. The red lines show a possible data path. You have been asked to choose an antenna for the mesh portal AP to accommodate all of the backhaul links. Which type of antenna would be optimal for this mesh deployment application?

Both the sector and the omnidirectional antennas would have enough beamwidth to cover the required angle (approximately 120 degrees or more), but the omnidirectional antenna would allow interference and noise from 360 degrees, whereas the sector would limit the interference to the facing 130 degrees required for useful coverage. Therefore, the sector antenna is a better choice.
