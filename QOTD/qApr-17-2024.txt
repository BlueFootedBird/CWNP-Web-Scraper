Virtual private networks (VPNs) are used to provide encrypted connections between devices and networks. VPNs typically include a combination of either gateway (concentrator) or client components and are often used to provide protected connectivity between remote locations or across unsecured mediums by implementing authentication, confidentiality (e.g. encryption), and integrity.
