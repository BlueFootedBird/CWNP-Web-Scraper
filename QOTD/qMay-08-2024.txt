What considerations should be made for Wi-Fi networks in retail environments where the APs only support WEP encryption?
a:PCI Compliance requirements for WEP use|b:Configuration of the server's X.509 certificate|c:Neighboring networks using the same WEP key|d:RADIUS server compatibility with the AP or controller|x:I don't know

Because of known weaknesses, WEP is not a recommended security solution for any network desiring strong authentication, integrity, confidentiality. WEP is typically deployed with key lengths of 64 or 128 bits, but the longer key length does not provide much, if any, added data confidentiality. WEP has several known hacking utilities that are free and very fast. Whenever possible, a stronger solution, such as WPA or WPA2 should be used. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) standard has detailed requirements for the use of WEP where cardholder information is stored or transmitted. According to the PCI, new WEP deployments are not allowed after March 31, 2009, and current implementations must stop using WEP after June 30, 2010. Retailers should pay close attention to PCI requirements when deploying Wi-Fi networks. Certificates and RADIUS servers are not used with WEP.
