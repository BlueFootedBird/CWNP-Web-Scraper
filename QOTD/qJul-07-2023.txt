ABC Company has chosen VPN technology to secure their 802.11g WLAN because employees roam both around the company's building and externally at hot spots around the country.  ABC Company's WLAN security policy requires an encryption algorithm stronger than RC4.  The network manager is considering L2TP as a VPN solution and asks you, a WLAN security consultant, what types of encryption algorithms L2TP uses.  What can you tell the network manager about L2TP?
a:AES-256 encryption is supported on every VPN platform that supports L2TP.|b:L2TP does not support encryption by itself, so it must be paired with a protocol that supports encryption in order to meet security policy requirements.|c:L2TP itself is an encryption algorithm stronger than RC4.  Additionally, a connectivity solution must be chosen to compliment L2TP.|d:L2TP can use RC5 encryption when used with 802.1X.|x:I don't know
b
L2TP does not support encryption by itself. L2TP is a layer 2 tunneling protocol used for connectivity only and is often paired with IPSec for encryption data transmission. IPSec can use DES, 3DES, and AES for encryption and the data payload is encrypted when using the Encapsulating Security Protocol sub-protocol of IPSec.
