When using an IEEE 802.11 protocol analyzer capable of decoding and analyzing VoWiFi calls, what values indicate to the analyst that a caller should be satisfied with call quality?
a:Noise floor is -100 dBm|b:Bit error rate is <25 ppm|c:SNR value of 20 dB|d:R-Value is 80|e:MOS value is 4.1|x:I don't know

MOS (Mean Opinion Score) and R-Value (also called Transmission Rating Factors) are different ways to determine voice quality in VoWiFi. Most VoWiFi analyzers use both MOS score and R-Value to analyze the quality of calls made using VoWiFi phones. For this reason, it is necessary to have a basic idea what these two terminologies mean. MOS scores are the most commonly used way by which respondents are asked to rate the quality of a call (i.e., how it sounds) on a 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent) scale. Anything that is above 4 is considered excellent. However, such rating is in and of itself very subjective due to the lack of an objective and scientific methodology. R-Values are defined by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in its standard G.109. R-Values are based on a computational/analytical process rather than the human ear. They can range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). An R-Value of 80 indicates that all users are satisfied, and R-Values in the 70s generally correlate to the quality of good cellular voice service.
