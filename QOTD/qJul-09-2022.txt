There are a variety of ways to power access points, including single-port or multi-port midspan PoE injectors, endpoint devices such as 802.3af or 802.3at PoE Ethernet switches, and AC power from an outlet. A network designer should carefully consider cost, deployment feasibility, power budget, and heat (and the associated cooling requirement) when choosing how to power APs.
