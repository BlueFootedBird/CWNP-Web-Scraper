A Wi-Fi user is associated to an 802.11b AP on the opposite end of a 15-meter (49 feet) hallway.  Users in this area are experiencing long delays and poor video quality while they watch streaming videos from a network server.  It has been determined that there is no physical interference in the area, and all stations are associated to the AP at the maximum supported data rate.What is the most likely cause of the long delays and low quality video?
a:The hallway is contributing to line-of-sight conditions, which causes signal corruption.|b:The users' stations are located too far from their servicing AP.|c:The streaming video requires more throughput than the 802.11b Wi-Fi network provides.|d:The network server's 10/100 Mbps Ethernet connection is causing a throughput bottleneck.|x:I don't know

High bandwidth applications like streaming video over Wi-Fi require a great deal of throughput, often more than 802.11b APs can provide with acceptable quality. With the increased popularity of high definition video and multimedia applications, performance demands for Wi-Fi are being challenged, which requires a significant consideration for hardware, network design, and application use.
