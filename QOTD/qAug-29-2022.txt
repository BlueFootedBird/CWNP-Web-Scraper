Band steering can be an effective tool in all WLANs, but it is particularly beneficial in high density networks. It works by simply ignoring 2.4 GHz requests and responding to only 5 GHz requests once the 2.4 GHz maximum connection limit is reached. Alternatively, it will always delay a response in the 2.4 GHz band to see if the client attempts to connect on the 5 GHz band. If the client does not connect on the 5 GHz band, the AP may respond to future attempts (probe requests or authentication requests) in the 2.4 GHz band. When wireless clients support dual-band operations, the MAC address is the same for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radios. Therefore, an AP that sees the same MAC address on its 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radios knows that it is the same client. From there, the AP can push the client to the 5 GHz band where many more channels are available and higher densities can be achieved.
