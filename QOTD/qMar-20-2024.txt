Given: The exhibits illustrate decoded sections of the same Beacon frame from an 802.11n AP.  What statement is definitively true of the frame decodes shown in the exhibit?
a:Since it supports MRC, the 802.11 chipset in this AP must be either 2x3 or 3x3 MIMO.|b:This AP does not support Block Acknowledgements.|c:This BSS is limited to a GI of 800 ns.|d:This BSS does not support frame aggregation.|e:Due to Rx and Tx STBC support, this AP only supports one spatial stream.|f:This AP cannot use the legacy SIGNAL field to set the NAV of other STAs to protect an entire frame exchange.|x:I don't know
f
As you can see in the first exhibit, L-SIG TXOP is not supported. With L-SIG TXOP, stations use the legacy SIGNAL field of an HT-mixed mode PLCP header to set the NAV of other stations to protect an entire frame exchange. You can also extract that frame aggregation is supported, 400 ns guard intervals (GI) are supports, BlockAcks may be supported (Delayed BlockAcks are not, though), and two receive and transmit spatial streams are supported. Similarly, MRC does not require three antennas, and no mention is made in the decodes that MRC is supported at all. Most MIMO implementations support it, but it may be supported with 2x2 MIMO configurations.
