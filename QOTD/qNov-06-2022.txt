ABC Corporation has implemented an IPSec security solution to protect their new 802.11g WLAN.  You are hired to audit the WLAN security and find that data is traversing the wireless segment in clear text.  You notify the network manager, but he argues that IPSec is supposed to protect data using strong encryption.  You explain that they have implemented IPSec improperly, causing data to be sent in clear text.  Which IPSec protocol has ABC Corp implemented to cause traffic to traverse the wireless medium in clear text?

Authentication Header (AH) is used by IPSec to authenticate header information and to mitigate bit flipping and replay attacks. The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol is used both for authentication and for encryption (depending on the version of ESP used). AH does not encrypt the data payload, but rather only assures that the data sent from source to destination has not been altered and is actually from the authenticated source node.
