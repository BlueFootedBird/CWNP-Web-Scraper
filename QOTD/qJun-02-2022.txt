In high density network environments, the primary goal is to increase the number of unique contention domains to maximize the number of devices that can transmit or receive at any given time. Another important goal is to maximize the efficiency of each transmission by reducing interference, increasing data rates, decreasing retries and errors, and encouraging higher-rate transmissions. To accomplish the first goal of RF isolation and increased contention domains, channel stacking can be used in an SCA to layer the network connectivity across multiple channels. In an MCA network, this is accomplished by reducing the AP’s service footprint by lowering the transmit power and antenna gain while adding co-located APs for higher density. More non-overlapping channels are better (assuming all clients support the channels), so if you can, leave DFS channels in 5 GHz enabled.Protocol mechanisms that encourage higher data rates include band steering (moving more clients to 5 GHz), airtime fairness, and simply preventing lower rates by disabling them.
