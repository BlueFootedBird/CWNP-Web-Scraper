As a consultant, you have been hired to design a wireless LAN security solution.  Of primary concern is a wireless man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.   Which security solution will prevent this type of attack?
a:802.1X/PEAP|b:MAC filters|c:RADIUS|d:LDAP|e:L2TP VPN|x:I don't know

PEAP stands for Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol. This protocol was developed to transmit authentication data, including passwords, over 802.11 wireless networks. PEAP uses server-side digital certificates to authenticate wireless clients by creating an encrypted SSL tunnel between the client and the authentication server, which then protects the exchange of data over the wireless network. These encrypted tunnels prevent intrusion by unwanted persons and help prevent MITM attacks as well.Most wireless access points contain some type of MAC ID filtering that allows the administrator to only permit access to computers that have wireless functionalities that contain certain MAC IDs. This can be helpful; however, IT personnel must remember that MAC IDs over a network can be spoofed (faked). There are many software utilities that allow MAC addresses to be changed easily.RADIUS is an authentication protocol, and by itself has no means to prevent MITM attacks. LDAP is a database type and protocol. In a wireless LAN, RADIUS may proxy authentication to an LDAP server to verify the identity of an authenticating user.L2TP VPNs do not, by themselves, provide encryption. Encryption is the key component to preventing MITM attacks.
