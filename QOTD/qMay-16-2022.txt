If two 802.11g access points are placed on the same channel in the same physical area (within 20 feet), what results will occur?
a:The total available bandwidth to users will increase|b:Co-channel interference will increase|c:One access point will automatically disable its radio|d:Client stations will load-balance between access points|e:Protection mechanisms will be initiated in each BSS|x:I don't know
b
The Basic Service Area is the coverage area around an access point in which client stations connect to the access point. When two access points are on the same channel with overlapping service areas (same physical space), there will be co-channel interference on that channel between the two Basic Service Sets (BSS). 802.11 networks utilize CSMA/CA to manage access to the shared wireless medium. If one station detects transmissions from another station, it will defer its own transmission attempts until the other AP has ceased transmitting. If the two APs were on adjacent overlapping channels (channels directly next to each other in the spectrum, such as 1 and 2), there would be adjacent-channel interference between the BSSs in this scenario. To minimize interference from other APs, adjacent non-overlapping channels, such as 1, 6, and 11, should be used.
