When choosing WLAN client devices, which of the following should you consider?
a:PC Cards that are from different manufactures but use the same chipset will offer the same performance and functionality.|b:PCMCIA and mini-PCI  are the most common WLAN adapter interfaces on modern laptops.|c:External WLAN adapters require a vendor-specific driver, while internal WLAN adapters are always natively supported by the operating system.|d:Installing a specific third-party driver not provided by the card manufacturer may enable the card to perform additional functions.|x:I don't know
d
Client's WLAN cards are independent of each other, so changes made in one card's utilities will not affect the configuration of other cards. Changes must be made at each client WLAN card. The performance and functionality of a PC Card is a result of the card's drivers and client utilities, so two vendors using the same chipset can have very different functioning cards. Every laptop made today includes USB ports and some laptops also include ExpressCard slots. Although they are becoming more rare, some models still ship with PC card interfaces, but they are certainly not the most common. Internally, most laptops support either mini-PCIe or half mini-PCIe. Many vendors use drivers built into operating systems, and so installing a specific card manufacturer's driver may not be required. Drivers are software or firmware code that allow the operating system of the device to communicate with the hardware.
