What statements are true regarding access point firmware updates?
a:A WNMS distributes firmware to autonomous access points.|b:A WIPS distributes firmware to multiple vendors' autonomous access points.|c:A WLAN controller distributes firmware to lightweight access points.|d:Client devices notify the WNMS when an access point's firmware is out-of-date.|e:Autonomous access points automatically update firmware on their neighboring access points.|x:I don't know

Both (autonomous access point or WLAN controllers with lightweight APs) solution architectures provide a centralized many-to-one update model. The value lies in trying to obtain some 'economy of scale' for larger architectures, whether based upon autonomous (i.e. fat) or lightweight (i.e. thin) access points.The WNMS requires a centralized software device manager that simplifies the management of distributed and disparate technologies. WNMS can perform a number of functions, from 'templatizing' device configurations to updating the firmware on autonomous access points.WLAN controllers are the 'brains' behind the lightweight access point architecture. The controller device represents the centralized component used for communicating with multiple APs, managing traffic flows, and updating AP firmware when needed.
