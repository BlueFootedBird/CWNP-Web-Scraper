As an RF signal passes through a cement block wall, the wall primarily _______ the RF signal. (Choose 2)

a
Absorption occurs when the RF signal strikes an object and is absorbed in to the material in such a manner that it does not pass through, reflect off, or bend around the object. A single concrete or cinderblock wall often significantly absorbs the signal, causing enough attenuation that the resulting signal is useless to 802.11 receivers. Some reflection may occur as well.Reflection occurs when a wave strikes an object that has reflective surfaces like steel construction, roofs, metal blinds, and metal doors, likely causing multipath.Refraction is the bending of a radio wave as it passes through a medium of different density. Diffraction is the bending of a radio wave around an obstacle. Scattered waves are produced by rough reflective surfaces, small objects, or by other irregularities in the signal path, and can be thought of as lots of little reflections.
