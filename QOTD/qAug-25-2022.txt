As a wireless security expert, you've been hired by XYZ Company to perform a security audit on their wireless network.  After reviewing their wireless implementation, you have discovered they use PPTP VPN tunnels to protect all wireless communications.  What do you tell XYZ Company regarding the vulnerabilities of using this solution?
a:Susceptible to DoS attacks that can cause the system to crash by attacking the AES listening port|b:Hashes used by MSCHAP v1 or v2 can be retrieved and quickly cracked|c:Possible to eavesdrop clear text challenge/response handshake with protocol analyzer|d:Data packets are not encrypted when PPP packets are encapsulated inside of a GRE tunnel|x:I don't know

Per www.sans.org/resources/malwarefaq/pptp-vpn.php, Microsoft PPTP is vulnerable to the following:1) DoS: Can cause system to crash by attacking TCP/IP port 1723 on the listening server2) DoS: Can cause system to crash by attacking GRE (protocol 47) listening port on server (two variations)3) Information Compromise: Retrieve and quickly crack LANMAN hash from MSCHAP v1 clients4) Information Compromise: Retrieve and quickly crack NT hash from MSCHAP v2 clients5) Information Compromise: Spoof VPN server to intercept VPN traffic long enough to retrieve client has information.MS PPTP does not use AES encryption. When PPP packets are encapsulated inside of the GRE tunnel carried by IP, only the data packets are encrypted (optional) and all other PPP traffic is not encrypted.
