Given: Use the graphic as a reference.  You are responsible for deploying a long-distance (10 km or 6 mi.) point-to-point WLAN bridge link using 802.11g. The link will provide connectivity between your enterprise facility and a remote data center. Between the buildings, a high amplitude (100 mW), 100% duty cycle video transmitter with an omni-directional antenna is on at all times. What impact will the video transmitter have on your wireless link?
a:If the transmitter’s signal interferes with more than 60% of the Fresnel zone, it will prevent your bridge link from working.|b:The interference will cause your link to fail unless you plan for additional transmitter or antenna gain to overcome the increased noise floor.|c:Regardless of Fresnel zone blockage, a source of interference between your links will corrupt the RF waves of your bridge transmissions, causing errors.|d:At this distance and power output, the video transmitter will not impact the bridge link.|x:I don't know
d
The RF behavior of long-range wireless bridge links is significantly different from that of indoor WLAN deployments. Because indoor links are typically short range, any nearby source of RF interference will likely impact the link because of omni-directional antennas on the client or AP, causing errors or backoff. However, in outdoor bridge links, the source of interference must be measurable at the receiving antenna of a bridge radio in order to cause interference. In the bridge link in question (based on the illustration), the video transmitter’s RF waves will not impact the bridge link. First, radio waves are not changed if they simply pass through interference. The interference must impact the receiver’s ability to receive the data signals. Second, with a distance of 5 km (3 miles) from the interferer to the bridge links, free space path loss will have completely eliminated any potential impact of this transmitter at both ends of the link.
