What is true of a site survey that is performed by 3D modeling software that also predicts (using color-coded heat maps on the floor plan) the data rates that should be experienced by WLAN clients?
a:The predicted connectivity rate is usually based upon the modeling software’s default receive sensitivity and data rate value pairs|b:The modeling software predicts the data rates based upon the measured receive sensitivity of the client device used to capture data|c:Most predictive modeling software provides a user-configurable list of WLAN client devices that will be used in the deployment, and it predicts the data rates for each adapter type included in the list.|d:Predicted data rates are typically an accurate gauge of real-world data rates to be expected within approximately a 10-foot (3 meters) radius on the floor plan.|e:Due to the variance in client receive sensitivity throughout the industry, these predicted values should only be used as a rough assessment, and not an actual rate to be expected in the real world.|x:I don't know

Data rate metrics are based upon much more than predicted signal strength. They are based on rate selection algorithms, receive sensitivity, RSSI, noise, SNR, loss, retransmissions, and other factors. A predictive survey can help provide a rough gauge of the data rates that should be expected—given a specific receive sensitivity and data rate value pair. However, reliable predictions about this metric are best obtained during an active survey or the actual post-deployment site validation survey. When predictive modeling software reports a data rate value, it is usually referencing a default table that matches receive sensitivity with measured RSSI. Some software programs allow the user to manipulate this table to match one of the clients that will be used, as shown in the graphic. This step can provide some improvement to data reliability.
