Given: A WLAN infrastructure vendor would like to implement new features to improve communication reliability with client devices in the network. As a part of this feature, the AP is collecting and reporting data about client connectivity metrics. One of the important metrics related to communication reliability is an uplink retry count.As it relates to an AP’s ability to identify an accurate client uplink retry count, which statement is true?
a:An AP can accurately collect and report client retry statistics by using the Retry and RetryCount subfields in the Frame Control field of data frames.|b:An AP can accurately collect and report client retry statistics by determining the CWmax used for client arbitration because the CWmax is contingent upon retry count.|c:An AP can accurately collect and report client retry statistics by polling the client with requests for STA Short Retry Count (SSRC) and STA Long Retry Count (SLRC) data.|d:An AP can accurately collect and report client retry statistics by use of the dot11RetryCount field in QoS data frames, which is required for all WMM certified client stations.|e:An AP can not accurately collect and report client retry statistics because APs can only identify successfully received data frames with the Retry bit set to 1.|x:I don't know
e
APs can only identify that previous retries existed, but they cannot maintain an accurate count of actual retries. The client can maintain this statistic, but, with current 802.11 standards, the AP is not capable of knowing this. Aside from selecting the Retry bit in individual frames, the client never communicates retry information across the wireless medium
