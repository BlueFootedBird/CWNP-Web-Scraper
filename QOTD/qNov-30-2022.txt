You are reviewing the floor plan of a prospective customer's facility and notice that the only network closet is located at one end of the 150-meter (490 feet) wide building.  What Wi-Fi network deployment problem could arise as a result of the customer's network closet location?
a:A single network closet will not have the Ethernet switch port capacity for all of the necessary APs.|b:Due to the length limitation of Ethernet cabling, it may not be possible to install APs on the opposite side of the building from the network closet.|c:Due to communication protocols, this distance will prevent most controller-based APs from discovering and being managed by the WLAN controller.|d:802.1X/EAP security cannot be performed on client devices at distances greater than 100 meters.|e:VoWiFi calls will experience significant audio delays when the data is forwarded through a WLAN controller at this distance.|x:I don't know

One of the initial steps in an RF site survey is to review the floor plan of the building that will be surveyed. In order to support data connectivity and possibly PoE, most APs require Category 5 (or higher) Ethernet cables to a network wiring closet. Modern building design should include centrally-located wiring closets; however, in the case that these closets are located at great distances from AP mounting locations, problems may arise due to the 100-meter distance limitations of Ethernet. In this event, additional switches may need to be mounted at intermediate locations to provide the Ethernet extension.
