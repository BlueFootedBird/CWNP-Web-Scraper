Given: If an AP’s transmit power greatly exceeds that of a client device, a problem with one-way communication may result. In this question, assume you are designing your network to support data, voice handsets, and guest traffic in a large, multi-story hospital. As you configure your APs with a balanced RF link in mind, what transmit power setting(s) is recommended for most APs as a best practice?
a:Less than 10 dBm|b:Less than 20 mW|c:More than 20 dBm|d:Less than 50 mW|e:Approximately 30-50 dBm|f:More than 100 mW|x:I don't know
d
In an environment where voice will be supported, it is important to design the network with the lowest common [radio] denominator in mind. Client radios typically are not capable of the same transmit power as APs, and that is especially true with voice devices, which are power-sensitive. For that reason, the AP could easily overpower the client devices and create a one-way link imbalance scenario or potentially prevent connectivity altogether. Many client devices are capable of transmitting at 30-50 mW, so a 50 mW maximum is often recommended for these deployments. Remember, best practices are not absolute rules. There will be times when 100 mW is fine.
