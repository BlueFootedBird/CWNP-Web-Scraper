Given:  The maximum output power provided by an IEEE 802.3af 33 PSE (Power Sourcing Equipment) port is 15.4 Watts, of which only 12.95 Watts are used by the PD (Powered Device).Approximately, what is the maximum port output power of an IEEE 802.3at PSE?
a:15 Watts|b:20 Watts|c:30 Watts|d:50 Watts|e:100 Watts|x:I don't know

The 802.3at amendment, commonly referred to as PoE+, was developed by the IEEE 802.3at task group, to meet the needs of devices requiring more power than 802.3af can provide. The 802.3at amendment extends the Power over Ethernet provision by using up to four pairs of standard Ethernet cable to provide up to 29.5 W of power to the PD, outputting 30 W on the port. The higher power available with this standard should make self-powered equipment with higher power requirements such as 802.11n APs, WiMAX transmitters, pan-tilt-zoom cameras, videophones, and thin clients possible.802.3at reaches higher power output by using all four of the wire pairs in an Ethernet cable. This new standard also supports midspan PoE with gigabit Ethernet connections.
