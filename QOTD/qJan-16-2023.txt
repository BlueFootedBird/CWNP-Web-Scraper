ABC Corporation implemented a PPTP/MS-CHAPv2/MPPE-128 VPN to secure its 802.11g WLAN one year ago.  ABC Corp's VPN concentrator has been using local authentication, and they have steadily grown to match the VPN server's maximum local authentication capacity.  As a consultant, you advise the network manager to consider what steps in order to scale this WLAN security solution and to strengthen its security?
a:ABC Corp's users should implement personal firewall software to prevent peer-to-peer attacks.|b:Implement WPA2-Personal at layer2 while leaving the PPTP VPN in place to increase scalability.|c:PPTP/RC4 should be changed to PPTP/AES to strengthen the VPN's encryption.|d:Once the VPN server's local database capacity is exceeded, ABC Corp should migrate to IPSec VPN technology for greater scalability.|e:ABC Corp should use RADIUS for authentication instead of local authentication on the VPN server.|x:I don't know

Most networks are attacked from inside the organization. Implementing personal firewall software will prevent or at least notify the user when attacks or requests are being made on their computer. The user will normally be able to accept or deny those actions accordingly. Personal firewalls are also included in Host Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS). Enterprise-capable RADIUS servers scale to large user deployments whereas local authentication solutions will not. Local authentication solutionsalso utilize the same processor that the other shared application is using thus making both operate slower when lots of traffic or authentications occur. This will reduce user throughput at a time when it is needed most. Also, RADIUS servers offer the ability to integrate into other centralized user databases like LDAP or Microsoft's Active Directory.
