Which statements are true regarding deployment of lightweight access points?
a:Lightweight access points support 802.3af and may connect directly to the WLAN controller or to an Ethernet switch.|b:Lightweight access points may connect to the WLAN controller with either a Layer-2 or a Layer-3 protocol.|c:Lightweight access points may be controlled over either Layer-2 or Layer-3.|d:Lightweight access points may use DNS to locate their assigned WLAN controller.|e:Lightweight access points cannot be deployed over the Internet due to Network Address Translation.|f:Lightweight access points may be configured for 802.11a or 802.11g, but not both simultaneously.|x:I don't know
a
All lightweight APs support 802.3af power over Ethernet. Most, but not all, lightweight access points support both a layer 2 and a layer 3 protocol for establishing connectivity to their assigned WLAN switch/controller. Layer 3 protocols might include LWAPP, GRE, and other similar protocols. When distributed lightweight access points power up, they will receive an IP address from the local LAN segment, including DNS parameters. The DNS name of their assigned controller will be pre-configured in the lightweight AP. After a DNS lookup, the lightweight AP will have the correct IP address of its controller, which will allow the AP to establish a layer3 tunnel terminating at its controller.
