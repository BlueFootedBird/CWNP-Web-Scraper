When troubleshooting 802.11 issues with a protocol analyzer related to an autonomous AP, where must you capture frames and why?
a:On the WLAN side, because you cannot capture 802.11 frames on the wired side of an autonomous AP|b:On the WLAN side, because you cannot capture Ethernet frames on the wired side of an autonomous AP|c:On the wired side, because 802.11 frames pass through in a tunnel from the autonomous AP to the switch|d:On the wired side, because software is not available to capture on the WLAN side|x:I don't know
a
The correct answer is On the WLAN side, because you cannot capture 802.11 frames on the wired side of an autonomous AP. It is very important to know where to capture frames for troubleshooting purposes. When troubleshooting networks services (DNS, DHCP, NTP, etc.), you may be able to capture on the wired side near the service server. When troubleshooting with the desire to analyze WLAN frames, you must capture on the WLAN side when an autonomous AP is used. If you have a controller-based AP, you may be able to capture frames on the controller.
