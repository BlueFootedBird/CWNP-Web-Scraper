Given: ABC Company is preparing for a new Wi-Fi network deployment in their corporate office. ABC has the following needs for their wireless network: 1.  20 APs for pervasive coverage    2.  3 SSID Profiles -- Data, Voice, and Guest    3.  Centralized management of AP configuration and firmwareWhat pairs of Wi-Fi network devices could be used to achieve ABC's Wi-Fi network requirements?

The most common solution to achieve ABC's requirements would be to use a WLAN Controller/Switch to manage controller-based APs. Autonomous APs are often used in smaller deployments where each AP is individually managed, but when autonomous APs are managed and configured via a Wireless Network Management System (WNMS), they can scale to meet the needs of the largest enterprise deployments. Controller-based APs require a controller/switch to perform some of the processing and management of some MAC layer functions, so a WNMS and controller-based AP pair would not meet ABC's need. However, controller-based APs can be managed by WLAN controllers. WLAN Controllers can also be managed by a WNMS. WIPS devices are used for security monitoring and policy enforcement.
