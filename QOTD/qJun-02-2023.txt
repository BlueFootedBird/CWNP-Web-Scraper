What factors would cause a client station to initiate a reassociation (Note: not an association) to another access point in an ESS?
a:The signal strength of the current AP increases|b:The client's bit error rate increases|c:The SNR of the current AP increases|d:Deauthentication requests from the current AP|e:A null SSID broadcast from another AP|f:A new AP sends a reassociation request to the client|x:I don't know
b
A client may only be associated with one access point at a time. As a client moves between basic service areas (BSA) it may roam from one access point to another if RSSI values drop below the client's roaming threshold or if the signal quality otherwise changes in an unacceptable way.The 802.11 standard does not dictate the specific details of roaming metrics within an extended service set (ESS), so roaming mechanisms are proprietary. Roaming is often based on RSSI values such as signal strength decreases, bit error rate (BER) increases, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases, and data rate shifting. Signal strength or SNR increases would not typically cause a client to roam. Because a deauthentication also terminates the association, a client must authenticate before reassociating with another AP.
