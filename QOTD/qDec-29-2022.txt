Role-based access control (RBAC) refers to the general process of applying roles or groups to users. Then filters, rules, and permissions are applied to a security policy. Finally, a security policy is mapped to a specific group or role. In the end, a user is assigned a security policy through its role. The security policy sets the rights or permissions of the user.
