As part of an organization's security policy, which recommendations best describe how to address the problem of rogue access points and Ad Hoc networks?
a:Deploy a wireless intrusion prevention system|b:Use narrowband RF jamming devices to interfere with all non-corporate spread spectrum channels|c:Set rules for the appropriate use and location of rogue wireless equipment|d:Administrator and end user training on the risks of rogue wireless networks|e:Perform daily rogue searches around the facility|x:I don't know
a
It is not feasible in most cases to do manual facility-wide searches for rogue equipment. It is much more feasible to let automated tools such as WIDS/WIPS systems do the work for you. A wireless IPS can locate and disable rogue access points and wireless Ad Hoc networks using sensors deployed around the facility. Administrators should be trained in order to understand how to detect and eliminate rogue APs, and end users should be trained so that they understand the risk of placing rogue devices on the network.
