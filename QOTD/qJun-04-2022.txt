A WLAN administrator determined that an antenna had to be moved to a new location in order for a bridge link to have proper line of sight and Fresnel zone clearance. She uses a longer RF cable to achieve the new positioning. What should happen next?
a:The link will function according to the existing link budget calculations|b:A new link budget must be calculated based on the increased loss of the longer cable|c:The link will definitely cease to function because of the loss incurred by the longer cable|d:VSWR will definitely occur due to the use of the longer cable|x:I don't know
b
When adding a longer cable, the new loss values must be considered and a new link budget calculated. A higher gain antenna or increased output power at the transmitter may be required to account for this new loss level. The link will not function according to the existing link budget calculation though it may still work if the existing fade margin was large enough. A new link budget should be calculated instead of assuming that it will work. The link may not cease to function due to fade margin that could have been in the original link budget, but this does not rule out the need for a new link budget calculation. VSWR may not be worsened as long as there is no impedance mismatch in the new cable.
