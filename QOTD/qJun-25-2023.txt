An IEEE 802.11 protocol analyzer using a single radio, dual-band 2.4 GHz (ERP) / 5 GHz (OFDM) PC Card is able to perform which tasks?
a:Capture and decode IEEE 802.11-compliant FHSS access point transmissions in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.|b:Capture and decode all non-HT protection mechanism frames.|c:Capture and decode OFDM and ERP-OFDM transmissions simultaneously.|d:Capture and decode 40 MHz data transmissions with an HT-mixed mode PPDU.|e:Capture, decrypt, and decode WPA2-Enterprise (PEAP-MSCHAPv2) AES-CCMP compliant unicast data frames.|x:I don't know
b
Only HR/DSSS, ERP, and OFDM transmissions in the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII bands will be recognized by such a protocol analyzer, due strictly to the capabilities of the radio card. HT-mixed format and HT-greenfield format frames use frame structures and modulation types that would not be understood by an 802.11a/b/g receiver. However, protection mechanisms intended for legacy stations would be understood by the protocol analyzer in question. Since WPA compliant 802.1X/EAP systems use keys chosen randomly by an authentication server, a wireless LAN analyzer would not be able to decode these frames given only a username and password. A protocol analyzer can only capture on one channel at a time, and thus capturing OFDM and HR/DSSS at the same time is also not possible.
