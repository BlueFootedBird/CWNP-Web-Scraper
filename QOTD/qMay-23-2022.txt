An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a set of rules which restrict the ways in which the network may be used. Enforcement of AUPs varies with the network. AUPs are also used by schools, corporations, etc., delimiting what is and is not permitted for use of the computers. The intent is to help protect the network from the introduction of malicious software, and to avoid unnecessary performance problems.
