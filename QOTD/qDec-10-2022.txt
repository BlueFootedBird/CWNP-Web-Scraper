You are troubleshooting QoS issues related to VoIP calls. You are concerned that the voice data packets are not being properly marked as they traverse the network. To ensure the proper configuration, where should you capture traffic and analyze QoS markings?
a:At the originating STA AP|b:As near the Call Manager as possible|c:As near the sending VoIP device as possible|d:As near the receiving VoIP device as possible|x:I don't know
d
The correct answer is As near the receiving VoIP device as possible. As the packets traverse the network they will be decapsulated and retagged or marked again and the quickest way to verify that the proper markings are on the packets is to analyze the traffic stream nearest the receiving VoIP device. VoIP communications are broken into two streams: call management and voice packets. The voice packets are transmitted directly from the sender to the receiver. The call management packets are sent to the Call Manager. In this case, voice data packets are in question and not call management packets.
