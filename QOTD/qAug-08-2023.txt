In WLANs where many client devices are located in a small area, client load balancing across multiple APs on different channels can be helpful for improving overall network performance. In what ways can this type of client load balancing be performed?
a:The AP can selectively choose to send probe responses at initial client authentication or it can ignore the client’s probe requests|b:The AP can selectively choose to send association responses at initial client authentication or it can ignore client association requests|c:The AP can send directed Load Management frames to associated clients to notify them that their association is moving to a new channel and AP/BSSID.|d:The AP can send downlink reassociation request messages to associated clients to encourage them to move to a new channel and AP/BSSID.|e:Clients associated to APs on the same controller can be transferred to new APs transparently (to the client) using proprietary intra-controller handoff protocols.|f:The AP can send association response messages with a failure code that identifies another BSSID in the ESS to which the client should attempt to associate.|x:I don't know

Currently, client load balancing operation is not as mature as you might expect. Although there are options to deauthenticate a client in order to force it to roam, this is not an ideal solution because the client is left stranded until it can choose a new AP and perform the full authentication and association processes. The protocol does not currently provide a type of notification message to be sent from the infrastructure that tells the client to roam to a new AP. Instead, preemptive load balancing is typically used whereby the APs selectively respond to probe requests and association requests. If the WLAN determines that a specific AP would be ideal for the client, only that AP would respond to the client. In turn, this funnels the client to the appropriate AP.
