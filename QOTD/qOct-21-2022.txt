The primary purpose of a Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) is to prevent unauthorized wireless access to local area networks and other information assets. These systems are typically implemented as an overlay to an existing Wireless LAN infrastructure, although they may be deployed standalone to enforce no-wireless policies within an organization. Most WIPS configurations consist of three components: Sensors - These devices contain antennas and radios that scan the wireless spectrum for packets and are installed throughout areas to be protected. Server - The WIPS server centrally analyzes packets captured by sensors. Console - The console provides the primary user interface into the system for administration and reporting. Appropriate uses for WIPS include real-time location tracking, defining and monitoring wireless network policies, rogue access point or client device detection and mitigation, and security and performance report generation.
