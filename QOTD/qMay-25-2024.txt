How can a 2.4 GHz 802.11n client station protect its frame transmission to reduce the likelihood of collisions from legacy stations?
a:Transmit using an RTS/CTS frame exchange|b:Configure its PD classification to Class 1|c:Set its QoS level to best effort priority|d:The CSMA/CA protocol prevents collisions automatically|e:Set the “More Data” bit to 1 in ACK frames|x:I don't know

If a station has been configured to use RTS/CTS, it will transmit an RTS frame before sending a data frame. Upon receiving the RTS frame, the AP will broadcast a CTS frame. (If a station did not hear the RTS frame from another station it will hear the CTS frame from the access point.) The RTS and CTS frames contain a Duration value (which other stations use to set their backoff timer) that will 'protect' the network long enough for the station to transmit its data frame and receive the corresponding ACK. It should be understood that RTS/CTS adds significant overhead to an 802.11 network, and should be used be used only when there is a requirement for it. The two primary uses for frame protection are backwards compatibility with legacy PHYs and hidden nodes. In both of these cases, an RTS/CTS can reduce the likelihood of collisions.
