a:Lowering the gain on a wireless receiver|b:Removing the antenna from a wireless receiver|c:A reflected signal received 130 degrees out of phase of the main signal|d:A signal traveling through open air|e:A fade margin increased by 5%|x:I don't know
c
Free Space Path Loss refers to the loss incurred by an RF signal due to 'signal dispersion', which is a natural broadening of the wave front. As the signal propagates, its power level per unit of space decreases.Phase is the relationship between the amplitudes of two RF signals that have the same frequency. Phase is measured in degrees. Two signals with the same amplitude that are completely in phase result in a stronger signal, while signals 180 degrees out of phase completely cancel each other out. Signals partially out of phase strengthen or weaken each other proportionally to their phase and amplitude relationship.Fade margin is an extra amount of signal strength (in dB) added to a link budget to ensure a reliable connection as signal strength fluctuates.Changes on a receiver will not affect the attenuation of an RF signal.
