Given: You have a wireless network that supports several IEEE 802.11 standards or draft standards, including 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11i, and 802.11s.What can you conclude regarding your wireless network? (Choose 2)
a:It can operate in either the 2.4 or 5 GHz unlicensed bands|b:It supports mesh networking|c:It supports mandatory rates of 54 Mbps|d:It supports 128-bit or 256-bit AES-CCMP encryption|e:It does not support fast secure roaming|f:It supports four QoS frame queues|x:I don't know
a
The 802.11s ESS Mesh Networking standard shall enable interoperable formation and operation of an ESS Mesh, but shall be extensible to allow for alternative path selection metrics and/or protocols based on application requirements. In a mesh network, mesh APs communicate with their neighbors, forming a resilient wireless backhaul and failover scenario. Information such as traffic load, neighbors, and best path forwarding, is passed amongst the mesh routers.802.11a access points operate in the 5 GHz bands. 802.11a and 802.11g both have mandatory data rates of 6, 12, and 24 Mbps, but not 54 Mbps. 802.11g also has mandatory data rates of 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbps for backward compatibility with 802.11g. 802.11i uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm with the Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) protocol (CCMP) with a 128-bit key and block cipher only. It does not support a 256-bit key or block cipher. Also, there is not enough information to conclude that the network does not support a method of fast secure roaming or that it does support QoS.
