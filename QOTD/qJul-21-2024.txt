You have been asked to recommend a solution for protocol capture of 802.11 frames consisting of 3x3:3 802.11ac communications. The requirement specifies that you must be able to capture frames from any location including specific user work areas and near APs. What solution would you recommend so that the requirements are met?
a:Install sufficient APs so that an AP can be taken offline to perform protocol analysis as needed|b:Install the minimum number of APs required for coverage and use these APs for protocol analysis as needed|c:Install laptop-based protocol analyzers and ensure the laptop includes the appropriate chipset for capture|d:Install Wireshark on the APs natively to allow dynamic capture while serving clients|x:I don't know
c
The correct answer is Install laptop-based protocol analyzers and ensure the laptop includes the appropriate chipset for capture. The requirement of capturing from any location does not allow for infrastructure-based capture. A laptop analyzer must be used and a chipset must be provided that works with the analyzer to capture 802.11ac 3x3:3 traffic.
