You are tasked with designing a high-density Wi-Fi network using a multiple channel architecture (MCA) model. In your design and configuration of the APs, which statement is true?
a:By lowering AP transmit power down to 1 mW, WLAN capacity is maximized; if the APs do not cause co-channel interference with neighboring same-channel cells, clients will not cause co-channel interference either.|b:To minimize co-channel interference and optimize channel use, you should design a channel reuse pattern that alternates the channel assignments of neighboring APs between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels.|c:In high-density WLAN designs with multiple floors, it is a best practice to perfect the AP layout on one floor, and then replicate the AP layout on each floor for consistency, minimal interference, and ease of deployment.|d:If your design calls for the use of omni-directional dipole antennas, lowering AP transmit power and increasing AP density can increase capacity, but too much AP density will eventually cause excessive interference, decreasing overall capacity.|x:I don't know
d
There are several design and implementation best practices to keep in mind when deploying a high-density WLAN. At the most fundamental level, the goal is to increase the number of contention domains by isolating RF coverage. This goal is accomplished largely by managing three different aspects of the spatial design:(1) AP propagation area, which is determined primarily by antenna gain and direction as well as transmit power, (2) Channel reuse, which is the strategic assignment of operating channels for neighboring APs throughout the facility, and(3) AP placement, which creates physical isolation between cells.We must remember that decreasing transmit power and effective range of the AP will generally add capacity, but if this principle is taken too far, closely co-located APs can interfere with each other, causing additional co- and adjacent-channel interference. Additionally, client transmit power is generally static, so if you decrease the AP’s transmit power (for example, down to 1 mW) and measure your contention according to AP transmit power only, you may still have clients on the same channel that are transmitting at 50 mW, interfering with neighboring cells on the same channel.
