Given: As a result of two different wireless rollouts, ABC Company has two separate, legacy WLAN infrastructures, both using autonomous APs and the same wired network infrastructure. Both WLANs are using a different VLAN.
WLAN-1 is protected by WEP and is used by corporate VoWiFi devices and corporate laptop users. All devices operating on WLAN-1 are TKIP or CCMP capable.
WLAN-2 is protected by an HTTPS captive portal and is used by guest users.
The current network administrator has decided to change to a controller-based architecture with centralized data forwarding for all WLAN access, and as he plans the rollout of the new architecture, he has sought your opinion to identify the best security configuration for this situation.
Based on best practices and common deployment techniques, as a consultant, what suggestions do you give the network administrator? (Choose 4)
a:Configure the WLAN controller to support IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging|b:Configure the corporate laptop WLAN as an RSN with support for PEAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication|c:Replicate the current guest WLAN configuration with an HTTPS captive portal configuration|d:Configure the VoWiFi SSID as a Transitional Security Network (TSN) to continue to support WEP devices along with TKIP/CCMP.|e:Configure the controller-based APs for IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging|f:Configure separate SSIDs for voice, guests, and laptop users, and segment each WLAN into a distinct VLAN.|x:I don't know
a
Lightweight APs are typically not configured for IEEE 802.1Q tagging, but rather are connected to an access port on a layer-2 Ethernet switch where they 1) get an IP address via DHCP, 2) download their firmware and configuration, and 3) build a layer-2 or layer-3 (more typical) tunnel to the WLAN controller. A TSN supports WEP, but the question itself indicates that all stations in that WLAN are capable of TKIP or CCMP, thus there is no reason to support WEP.
