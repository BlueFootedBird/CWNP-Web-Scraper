Several factors should be considered when selecting RF accessories for a transmission system. Because all RF cables and connectors introduce loss into a system, components should be chosen carefully to minimize loss. In particular, longer cables introduce more loss, so the shortest possible cable should be used. RF cables and connectors also have a range of frequencies in which they will work. Because there are several different types of RF connector types, they should be chosen carefully to match the devices that need connecting.
