When a point-to-point link's transmission quality and strength are decreased by Fresnel zone blockage, which Line-of-Sight type is affected?

Visual line-of-sight is being able to see (with your eyes) one end of the RF link path from the other end. Distance links using Radio Frequency (RF) line-of-sight involves the assurance that at least 60% of the first Fresnel zone is clear of obstacles that block the RF signal. When the Fresnel zone is blocked, signal strength and quality will decrease. When more than 40% of the Fresnel zone is blocked, the entire link may fail. In theory, there are an infinite number of Fresnel zones. In practice, engineers need only take into consideration the effects of the first Fresnel zones. The first Fresnel zone has the greatest impact on an RF signal. There should be a clearance factor of at least 60% (<40% blockage) for the first Fresnel zone. A value of >80% clearance is preferable. The optimum situation would provide 100% clearance, however there may be deployment constraints that prevent full clearance (increased mount or tower height etc).
