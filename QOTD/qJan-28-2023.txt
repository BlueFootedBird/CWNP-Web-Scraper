A single user is complaining that her VoWiFi phone has choppy audio. The WLAN administrator notices that the user’s MAC address has a retry rate of 25% when observed with a protocol analyzer. However, all the other users have a retry rate of about 5% when observed with the protocol analyzer.What is the most likely cause of this problem?
a:Failed 802.11 association|b:Mismatched security keys|c:802.11 arbitration|d:Hidden node|e:Low noise floor|x:I don't know

If an end user complains of a degradation in performance, there are several possible causes. An important first step is to attempt to identify environmental characteristics that are unique to the individual having trouble. Localized environmental problems are often RF interference, low SNR, multipath, or possibly contention-related issues caused by nearby networks. Hidden nodes are another possible explanation for individual client performance problems. If the protocol analyzer indicates a higher retransmission rate for the MAC address of one station when compared to the other client stations, a hidden node may have been found. Some protocol analyzers even have hidden node alarms based on retransmission thresholds.
