ABC Company has recently installed an 802.11g wireless LAN and is in the process of performing a baseline throughput analysis.  The network administrator has gathered some data and determined that the 802.11g network's throughput performance is much lower than expected and wishes to discover what is causing the performance degradation.  What troubleshooting equipment would be most effective and comprehensive for the network administrator to use to discover potential causes for low network throughput? (Choose 4)
a:A traffic generator performance test application|b:Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS)|c:Laptop protocol analyzer|d:A PC Card manufacturer's client utilities|e:Hidden node RF analyzer|f:Site survey predictive modeling tool|g:Multipath loss meter|x:I don't know

An RF spectrum analyzer (whether handheld, laptop-based, or distributed) would help administrators to locate narrowband or wideband RF interference that could be causing 802.11 frame retransmissions. Retransmissions can cause significant throughput degradation. WIPS and laptop protocol analyzers are both capable of finding security and performance problems as well, such as:1. Rogue access points that are interfering with authorized systems 2. Use of protection mechanisms in a BSS due to legacy HR/DSSS (802.11b) devices.The difference between laptop protocol analyzers and WIPS is where their WLAN radios are located. WIPS use distributed sensors around a facility, but laptop protocol analyzers use a single radio card. Client utility software could also be useful for validating client configuration and operating mode, such as 802.11b only, or mixed mode. Protection mechanisms may be hindering overall network throughput.Additionally, traffic generation applications designed to test network performance and throughput (such as iperf) are frequently used to simulate network traffic and validate performance.
