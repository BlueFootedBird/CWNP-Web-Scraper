You are implementing a RADIUS server and must ensure proper configuration of the network ACLs and firewalls. By default, how does a RADIUS server communicate with an authenticator? (Choose 2)
a:RADIUS IP packets protected by MD5|b:TCP ports 1645 and 1646|c:TCP port 443|d:UDP ports 1812 and 1813|x:I don't know

By default, the RADIUS protocol uses UDP port 1812 for RADIUS authentication and port 1813 for RADIUS accounting. These ports were officially assigned by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA). However, prior to IANA allocation of UDP ports 1812 and 1813, the UDP ports of 1645 and 1646 (authentication and accounting, respectively) were used as the default ports by many RADIUS server vendors. TCP is not used today, though the IETF has made efforts to formalize a more reliable RADIUS protocol extension using TCP. All Layer 2 EAP traffic sent between the RADIUS server and the authenticator is encapsulated in RADIUS IP packets, the payload of which is protected by the weak MD5 protocol. In 802.1X/EAP, the encrypted TLS tunnel communications are between the supplicant and the authentication server and not between the RADIUS server and the authenticator. IPsec is not used. Other IETF efforts are attempting to standardize the use of TLS encryption with RADIUS to improve upon the weaknesses of MD5 when RADIUS traffic crosses insecure network boundaries.
