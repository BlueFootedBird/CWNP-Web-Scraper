Grid and dish antennas are two types of highly directional antennas with narrow beam widths and high gain, which makes them well suited for outdoor point-to-point links that cover great distances. In Wi-Fi networks, these antennas are often used to establish connectivity between two remote buildings with line-of-sight conditions between them. Panel and patch antennas have a semi-directional coverage pattern and do not provide the gain or directionality required for long-range outdoor bridge links. Sector antennas are often used to provide semi-directional coverage for moderate distances, usually less than 2 miles.
