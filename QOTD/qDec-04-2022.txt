Given:  ABC Company has a WLAN controller with 5 WLANs configured, each with its own SSID, security parameters, and the default Beacon interval value of 100 time units (TUs).How often and in what manner are Beacons transmitted from a lightweight AP that is broadcasting Beacons for all 5 WLANs?
a:One Beacon will be transmitted onto the WM every 100 TUs, and the Beacons for each WLAN will be rotated round-robin.|b:One Beacon will be transmitted onto the WM every 20 TUs, and the Beacon for each SSID is transmitted every 100 TUs.|c:A single Beacon frame containing SSID information for each WLAN is transmitted onto the WM every 100 TUs.|d:One Beacon will be transmitted onto the WM for each WLAN every 500 TUs.|x:I don't know
b
The Beacon interval is generally thought of as an SSID-specific parameter, as it should be. However, many vendors require that the beacon interval be the same for all SSIDs supported by a specific AP radio. In any case, when a specific radio supports 5 SSIDs with a beacon interval of 100 TUs, each SSID requires a Beacon every 100 TUs. In other words, the radio will transmit a Beacon every 20 TUs. As yet, SSIDs from the same radio are not capable of sharing a single beacon.
