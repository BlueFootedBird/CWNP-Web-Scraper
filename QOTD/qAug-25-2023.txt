What field in the RSN information element (IE) will indicate the cipher suite used to encrypt multicast traffic?
a:AKM Suite List|b:Group Cipher Type|c:RSN Capabilities|d:Pairwise Cipher Suite List|x:I don't know

The group cipher type identifies what cipher type (encryption) is used for group traffic that traverses the wireless medium for the service set, which includes broadcast and multicast traffic. This group cipher is identified in the “Group Cipher Type” field. When a service set is configured only for CCMP and not TKIP, it makes sense that CCMP would be used for group traffic encryption as well as for unicast traffic, because it is the only cipher suite available. The group cipher will always be the lowest possible encryption type that is used in the service set. For example, if you have a service set that is configured for both CCMP and TKIP the lowest common type is TKIP, so the group cipher used to encrypt group traffic is TKIP. Any device that is capable of CCMP would also be able to understand TKIP so therefore there are no compatibility issues with the group traffic.
