By default, when WMM Power Save (WMM-PS) is supported in a BSS by WMM clients, what happens to downstream (from AP to client) multicast frames when all subscribers of the multicast group are awake prior to a Beacon?
a:They are converted to unicast and sent to each individual station at the client’s highest supported rate.|b:They are buffered by the access point until data for the multicast group is requested with an APSD trigger frame.|c:They are buffered by the access point until the next DTIM.|d:At the AP’s first TXOP, they are sent to the multicast group using the lowest data rate of the client stations in the multicast group.|e:At the AP’s first TXOP, they are sent to the multicast group using a data rate in the BSS’s basic rate set.|f:The multicast frames are converted to unicast and sent individually, using the highest possible rate, to each station in the multicast group.|x:I don't know

When WMM Power Save is supported in a BSS, all group addressed traffic (multicast and broadcast) is buffered at the AP until the DTIM. A DTIM is a Beacon for which all power save stations must be awake because buffered group traffic is sent following the DTIM. The DTIM interval dictates which beacons are DTIM beacons. Buffering of multicast traffic can have a significant impact on performance for latency-sensitive multicast traffic types, such as streaming video or group addressed voice. For that reason, many vendors support proprietary multicast optimization features in which multicast traffic is translated into unicast traffic. This optimizes the delivery of multicast traffic in a number of different ways: frames can be acknowledged, they can be prioritized into a voice or video access category, and they can be sent at higher, unicast data rates. When group addressed traffic is finally sent in a BSS, the transmitting station always uses a rate in the Basic Rate Set. Support for these rates is required for all stations in the BSS.
