EAP-FAST uses symmetric key algorithms to achieve a tunneled authentication process. The tunnel establishment relies on a Protected Access Credential (PAC) (instead of an X.509 certificate) that can be provisioned and managed dynamically by EAP-FAST through the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server (such as the Cisco Secure Access Control Server [ACS] v. 3.2.3). With a mutually authenticated tunnel, EAP-FAST offers protection from dictionary attacks and man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities.
