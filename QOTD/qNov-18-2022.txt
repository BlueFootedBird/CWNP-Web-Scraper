WLAN controllers are layer-2\3 devices. Rogue detection and mitigation is available in almost all WLAN controllers and controller-based APs. HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, Telnet, and SSH1/2 protocols are generally used to manage WLAN controllers, with HTTPS, SSH2, and SNMPv3 being the recommended secure management methods. GLBP is not supported on WLAN infrastructure devices and 802.1Q tagging applies to Ethernet frames at layer 2, not layer 3. BSSIDs are usually assigned according to the MAC address of an AP's radio, based on the vendor’s BSSID iteration process, which is not configurable. When only one SSID is configured for an AP, the AP generally uses the base radio MAC address, but when many SSIDs are assigned to the same AP radio, the BSSID is an incremented value of the hardware MAC address. As most vendors incorporate features and design practices to accommodate 802.11n throughput rates, they are offering the option to tunnel data centrally (through the controller), or to perform local bridging at the AP.
