For what reason is MAC filtering considered a poor security solution in 802.11g Wi-Fi networks?
a:MAC address information is always transmitted in clear-text and is easily cloned on unauthorized client devices.|b:MAC filters only work with 802.11b access points and client devices.|c:Client devices have up to 4 MAC addresses, which can create excessive administrative overhead.|d:Encryption algorithms used for MAC address security in Wi-Fi networks are very weak.|e:Copying the 256-byte MAC address into a MAC filter often results in typographical errors.|x:I don't know

The MAC address of a Wi-Fi station is always transmitted in clear-text and can be easily captured and spoofed by attackers. Networking protocols depend on layer 2 Data-Link addresses (MAC addresses) of each device in order to determine the forwarding path of frames. For this reason, the MAC address is included in all frames sent along the wireless medium and can be gathered with protocol analysis tools. Free, easy-to-use utilities are also available for MAC spoofing, allowing attackers to clone a MAC address on their client cards. This allows an attacker to appear as an authorized station, bypassing the MAC filter. MAC filters are configurable with all 802.11a/b/g/n devices and are not tied to any one part of the 802.11 standard.
