You have connected a controller-based AP to the LAN. The controller is located using DNS and you have verified that the proper host records are in DNS and that DHCP is properly configuring the AP. This is the only AP on the subnet in question. The AP cannot reach the controller, but it can reach other devices on the same subnet. It has an IP address of 192.168.12.37 based on the DHCP logs. What should you check among the listed items in an attempt to resolve the issue?
a:Connect a laptop to the same Ethernet cable and verify DNS with NSLOOKUP|b:Check the ACLs in the router connected to the subnet|c:Connect a laptop to the same Ethernet cable and validate DHCP operations|d:Make sure the Ethernet cable is plugged into the AP|x:I don't know
b
Given that local network communications are working and the DHCP log shows an IP settings assignment, it would be beneficial to check the access control lists (ACLs) in the router to make sure they are not preventing the AP from reaching the controller. The other suggestions listed are not relevant based on the description.
