What measures can be taken to help protect a corporation's 802.11 wireless LAN from a jamming attack?
a:Deploy systems that only use unpublished, licensed frequencies|b:Require users on the wireless LAN to authenticate using 802.1X/EAP|c:Monitor the daily WIPS management reports for any deviation from the baseline settings|d:Increase physical security to create a buffer zone between the WLAN and the would-be attacker|e:Segment all wireless users onto a different VLAN than the wired users|x:I don't know
d
Since the power level of the typical 802.11 access point and client device is much lower than the power available to the attacker using an RF jamming device, there is little an administrator can do to prevent such a DoS attack. One security measure that will help is to keep the potential attacker as far from the wireless LAN as possible by increasing the physical security of the site.In most cases the use of a Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) would in fact catch the jamming attack and could in turn disable part of the wireless LAN, but simply monitoring the daily reports from the Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) would not protect a wireless LAN.
