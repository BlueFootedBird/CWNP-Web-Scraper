A manager has asked you to place the APs above the ceiling in a WLAN deployment. He has requested this for aesthetic reasons. You know this is not the best decision, what do you tell the manager in an attempt to influence him to make a better decisions?
a:It is impossible to power APs placed above the ceiling.|b:It is always against regulations to place APs above the ceiling.|c:Placing the APs above the cealing will prevent any possible configuration that would allow for client access.|d:Placing the APs above the ceiling will alter the requirements for the WLAN and may require more APs than would be otherwise needed.|x:I don't know
d
While it is possible to place APs above the ceiling, as long as it does not result in regulation non-compliance, it will significantly impact the coverage and capacity plan. The APs may have to use higher output power settings and more APs may be required. Additionally, CCI between APs within the ceiling (if the area is open) may be higher due to the installation of more APs or higher output power settings.
