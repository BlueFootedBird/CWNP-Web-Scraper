You have been hired to implement a large wireless network on ABC College's campus.  When choosing appropriate antennas, which of the following guidelines should you follow? (Choose 2)
a:When indoors, you will typically use a dipole antenna, which is an omni-directional antenna that radiates energy equally in all directions.|b:If you want a semi-directional antenna that is flat and designed for wall mounting, patch and panel antennas are appropriate choices.|c:Grid antennas make good highly-directional antennas on rooftops because they allow wind to pass through without changing the RF reception capabilities of the antenna.|d:When choosing an omni-directional antenna, increasing the antenna's gain will increase the antenna's horizontal and vertical coverage pattern and range.|e:Yagi antennas should include a driven element and a reflector element to create a waveguide that produces an omni-directional horizontal beamwidth.|x:I don't know
b
An isotropic radiator radiates energy equally in all directions. It is not possible to make an antenna with an isotropic radiation pattern, but a dipole antenna does radiate energy in all directions around the antenna's vertical axis. Patch, panel, and Yagi antennas are semi-directional antennas that can be flat and designed for wall mounting. Yagi antennas are always semi-directional, but most are used in outdoor point-to-point networks and often look like a long rod with tines. Many Wi-Fi Yagi antennas are enclosed inside a plastic cylinder for better durability. Grid antennas are designed for resisting heavy wind loads due to the grid shaped construction of the antenna. Despite the 'holes' in the antenna, RF energy is still collected at the antenna's specified frequency. While increasing an omni-directional antenna's gain will increase its horizontal range, it will decrease the antenna's vertical coverage pattern.
