ABC Hospital has spent a very large budget on a small 802.11g WLAN implementation to assure its security.  There are layer 2, layer 3, and layer 7 security solutions in place, and no matter how many networking tools and approaches you try, you cannot circumvent their security solution.  As an intruder, what is your next move in circumventing ABC's network security?
a:Theft of a wireless LAN enabled laptop that contains authorized user credentials|b:Use a wideband RF jamming device to interfere with the 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum, and then capture user credentials during reauthentication|c:Connect your own access point to an RJ-45 wall jack in an unsecured patient room|d:A call to ABC's help desk impersonating an authorized user in an attempt to gain network user credentials|e:Attempt to circumvent WEP on the hospital administrator's home WLAN|f:Theft of a lightweight (thin) access point to obtain cached user credentials|x:I don't know

Social Engineering is an out-of-band approach to circumvent security measures, and wireless LANs are no exception. No amount of security solutions can replace an effective security policy. Security policy will dictate training of help desk personnel to mitigate social engineering attacks such as this. Physical security of devices such as laptop computers that may hold digital certificates or username/password credentials is also imperative and should be addressed in the corporate security policy. Placing a rogue access point onto the wired network will allow the intruder to bypass all security measures in most cases. For this reason, good physical security and a quality wireless intrusion prevention system are key elements in a solid security solution.
