What is the most significant limitation of using an integrated WIPS compared to an overlay WIPS?
a:Integrated WIPS requires dedicated sensors for monitoring wireless activity.|b:Integrated WIPS cannot identify attackers using wireless clients operating in promiscuous mode.|c:Integrated WIPS can only scan the same channel being used for client connectivity.|d:Integrated WIPS cannot simultaneously process data traffic from wireless clients while also performing security analysis on other channels.|x:I don't know
d
In an integrated WIPS deployment, infrastructure APs are responsible for assessing traffic to identify attacks. Such an implementation is effective for monitoring the authorized infrastructure network but limits the ability to assess threats on wireless channels and frequencies outside those used by the wireless network. When an AP is responsible for sending and receiving wireless client communications, it is not able to scan other frequencies (channel hop) for attack activity.
