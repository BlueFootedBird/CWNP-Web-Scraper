Given: The XYZ Corporation employs 20 data entry clerks that use an unencrypted IEEE 802.11 WLAN to access the main network.  An intruder is using a laptop running a software access point in an attempt to hijack the wireless users.How can the intruder cause all of these clients to establish Layer 2 connectivity with the software access point?
a:WLAN clients can be forced to reassociate if the intruder's laptop uses a WLAN card capable of emitting at least 5 times more power than the authorized access point.|b:A higher SSID value programmed into the intruder's software access point will take priority over the SSID in the authorized access point, causing the clients to reassociate.|c:When the signal between the clients and the authorized access point is temporarily disrupted and the intruder's software access point is using the same SSID on a different channel than the authorized access point, the clients will reassociate to the software access point.|d:When the signal between the clients and the authorized access point is permanently disrupted and the intruder's software access point is using the same SSID and the same channel as the authorized access point, the clients will reassociate to the software access point.|x:I don't know

By design, when the connection between a WLAN client and access point drops below a certain threshold (determined differently by each vendor) the WLAN client will start looking for another access points on different channels with matching SSID which might provide a better connection, typically based upon RSSI values. Many devices will also continue to scan other channels for better options even while associated to an access point.Jamming the signal will drop the connection below the client's threshold, causing it to search for another alternative. When it discovers the intruder's software access point is using the same SSID and can provide a strong connection, the client station will reassociate to the software access point.
