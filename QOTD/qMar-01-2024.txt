What method uses multiple senders, receivers and streams to turn multipath propagation into a positive phenomenon, thus improving the speed in use by STAs and APs?

b
Multiple Input/Multiple Output (MIMO) uses multiple transmitters and receivers (radio chains) to send and receive multiple streams of data concurrently, thus increasing data rates.
