AP-3 is a 3x3:3 AP. STA-2 is a 2x2:2 client. What is the maximum number of spatial streams that can be used for a downlink VHT-OFDM transmission from AP3 to STA-2?
a:Two spatial streams, because the definition of the AP states that it is capable of only two spatial streams.|b:Three spatial streams, because the AP determines the number of available spatial streams and not the client.|c:Two spatial streams, because the definition of the client states that it is capable of only two spatial streams.|d:One spatial stream, because the definition of the AP indicates that it is capable of only one spatial stream.|x:I don't know
c
The number of available spatial streams is always the minimum number supported on either end of the link. Therefore, if the STA supports only 2 streams, the link can support only 2 streams. A 2x2:2 STA is one that can send and receive on two antennas and supports two spatial streams. The nomenclature is understood like this: Tx chains x Rx chains: spatial streams.
