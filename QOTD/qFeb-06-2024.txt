Channel reuse patterns are used to diminish or remove CCI and ACI. In 2.4 GHz reuse patterns help to mitigate the CCI, but in 5 GHz reuse patterns properly implemented can remove it. The concept of a channel reuse pattern is simply to avoid placing APs near each other that are on the same channel or, in 5 GHz, on an adjacent channel. The image shows an example channel reuse pattern in 2.4 GHz.
