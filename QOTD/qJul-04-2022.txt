Sections 8.5.1.3 and 5.9.2.1 of the 802.11i-2004 Amendment state that the Authenticator is responsible for generating and reinitializing the GMK. The GTK is derived from the GMK by the Authenticator during the 4-Way Handshake. The GTK is encrypted using the PTK and sent to the Supplicant during the 4-Way Handshake.
