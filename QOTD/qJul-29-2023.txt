There are three options for using out-of-band channels for configuration in the Wi-Fi Protected Setup proposal.Unencrypted SettingsThe first option places the WLAN Credential unencrypted onto the out-of-band media. Using this option is based on the assumption that the user will maintain physical control over the out-of-band media (such as an NFC token or USB flash drive). This control must be maintained even after the enrollment process is complete. The primary advantage of this option is convenience: the out-of-band media can be reused with new Enrollees without requiring the Registrar to be running at the time of introduction. Another important advantage of this option is that it works well with legacy APs that do not forward messages containing Enrollee public keys to the Registrar. The disadvantage is that if an attacker gains access to the out-of-band media, they will immediately obtain valid WLAN Credentials.Encrypted SettingsThis option uses a key derived from the Diffie-Hellman public key of the Enrollee obtained over the inband channel, along with that of the Registrar, to encrypt settings for that specific Enrollee. Although the settings are encrypted, it is still advisable to physically guard the out-of-band media from being read by an attacker.NFC Interfaces Operating in Peer-to-peer ModeThis mode has the strongest security properties supported by this specification because man-in-the-middle attacks against NFC are not feasible. In this mode, a 1536-bit Diffie-Hellman exchange is performed over the NFC interface, and WLAN settings are encrypted using 128-bit AES and delivered over the same interface. The Diffie-Hellman public keys and WLAN settings are implicitly authenticated by both the Registrar and the Enrollee, because they are received over the NFC channel.For more information, see the whitepaper 'Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for Wi-Fi Protected Setup: Easing the User Experience for Home and Small Office Wi-Fi Networks'.http://www.wi-fi.org/knowledge_center_overview.php?docid=4506
