LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a networking protocol based upon the X.500 standard for querying and modifying directory services running over TCP/IP. The core LDAP specifications are all defined in RFCs -- a complete list of LDAP-related RFCs may be found at the LDAPman RFC page found here: http://www.ldapman.org/ldap_rfcs.html.
