You are implementing a redundant wireless mesh network. The network will service primarily 2.4 GHz clients with some support for 5 GHz clients (less than 10%). Seven APs will be used in the mesh network and all APs must provide client access as well as backhaul links to the wired network through other mesh APs or through direct wired connections for two of the mesh APs. What band should be used for the backhaul links and why?
a:5 GHz because it is best in every scenario|b:5 GHz because it will be the least utilized band in this scenario|c:2.4 GHz because it is best in every scenario|d:2.4 GHz because it will be the least utilized band in this scenario|x:I don't know

A major decision in mesh implementations is the choice of band. In the past, many mesh networks were built on the assumption that 2.4 GHz clients would connect to the network and 5 GHz links would be used to build the mesh. This is no longer the only option. Today, it is quite common to have 5 GHz clients and they must be supported as well. In some cases, a mixture of 2.4 GHz mesh link radios with 5 GHz client access radios and others with 5 GHz mesh link radios and 2.4 GHz client access radios can work well. Effectively forming a dual overlay network, but the channel planning for the 2.4 GHz side is very challenging. Therefore, it is more common to implement 5 GHz mesh links (using channels that may not be supported by the clients) and 5 GHz client access as well as 2.4 GHz client access.
