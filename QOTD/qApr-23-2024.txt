ABC Company recently implemented wireless networks at many of their branch offices.  To determine RF coverage areas and access point placement, they measured the signal strength as reported in their laptop's wireless network card.What limitations does this “site survey” method include? (Choose 2)
a:It does not identify interference sources|b:Different vendors report different RSSI values from the same location|c:It predicts uplink application performance, but only for one adapter type|d:A laptop WLAN card does not accurately identify signal strength|e:It does not consider impact of security overhead on signal strength|x:I don't know
a
The 802.11-2007 standard does not specify how RSSI should be calculated, only that a vendor's hardware must be capable of reporting RSSI up to the driver, resulting in different implementations between vendors.Signal strength alone does not identify interference sources, so it does not test for a signal's viability, nor can it predict application performance. The power level of a narrowband signal relative to the power level of the noise floor is called the signal-to-noise ratio. SNR shows the strength of the RF signal versus the background noise, and is a good measure of the viability of the RF link. A spectrum analyzer is a useful tool for determining noise floor values and the presence of interfering signals.
