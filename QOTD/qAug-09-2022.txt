In Wi-Fi network deployments with large user groups requiring high security, there are several layers of security that should be enforced. Strong authentication and encryption should be supported with RADIUS and 802.1X/EAP, preferably with CCMP/AES encryption. The user-based security afforded by 802.1X/EAP solutions provides for granular control of network permissions and resources. This allows administrators to segment the network with user-based controls for maximum security. Also, wireless intrusion prevention systems (WIPS) are a fundamental security aspect for all Wi-Fi deployments. They are used to monitor the RF environment and report or respond to security threats such as rogue devices, denial of service (DoS) attacks, misconfigured devices, and other network threats.
