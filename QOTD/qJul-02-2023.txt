While 802.1X/EAP (also called WPA-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise) provides a user-based authentication and network privilege assignment mechanism, it is more difficult by far to implement than WPA2-Personal (Passphrase-based authentication, also called PSK) because of all of the pieces of the solution (supplicant, authenticator, & authentication server). A major advantage of 802.1X/EAP over Passphrase-based (PSK) security is the ability to revoke network access privileges on a per-user basis when employees leave the organization without affecting other users. This can now be also be accomplished through Per-user PSK security features, which, though non-standard, are available through multiple manufacturers. 802.1X/EAP initial authentication can take seconds, instead of the milliseconds taken by Passphrase-based security.
