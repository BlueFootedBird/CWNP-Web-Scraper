In your centralized WLAN architecture, your administration team would like to avoid manually provisioning each AP for controller discovery. What alternative methods are typically available for an AP to discover a centralized WLAN controller? (Choose 2)
a:Proprietary layer 2 or 3 broadcast discovery protocols|b:DHCP Option 53|c:Use DNS to resolve the controller’s IP address|d:RADIUS Return Attributes|x:I don't know

There are three common options for an AP to discover a WLAN Controller. · DHCP Option 43 uses a vendor-specific identifier in the DHCP Discovery that allows the AP to discover the IP address of a WLAN controller. · DNS can be used to resolve a controller’s IP address from a hostname. · Each vendor also includes a proprietary discovery protocol in which the AP will send broadcasts at either Layer 2 or 3 to discover available controllers. Layer 2 protocols are limited by requiring the WLAN controller and discovering APs on the same subnet.
