Before a station on a wireless LAN is allowed to transmit data, which of the following conditions must always be true? (Choose 2)
a:The station's virtual carrier sense must report an idle network.|b:The station's physical carrier sense must report an idle network.|c:The station's contention-free period must be set to '0'..|d:The station's DUR field must have a slot time equal to zero.|e:The station must transmit a CTS (Clear-to-Send) frame, reserving the medium.|f:The station must be polled by the AP.|x:I don't know
a
Before a station is allowed to transmit data, both the station's virtual and physical carrier sense must report an idle network. The slot time is a fixed-length time interval defined for each PHY (DSSS, OFDM, etc.) A station will determine the length of the backoff timer by choosing a random integer and then multiplying that number by the slot time. To reserve the medium, a station would send an RTS (Request-to-Send) frame, however, this is optional, and not required for a station to transmit data. The NAV field is an “advisory” to other STAs that the value contained within represents the amount of time required to complete the current frame transaction sequence (for example, a SIFS period followed by an ACK frame).
