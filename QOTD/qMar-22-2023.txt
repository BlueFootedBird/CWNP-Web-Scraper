Even when two APs are part of the same ESS, they are separate networks from a Basic Service Set (BSS) perspective. The clients are connected to one BSS and must move to another BSS to roam within an ESS. The client is fully associated with only on BSS at a time. Therefore, some time is required to move from one BSS to the next.
