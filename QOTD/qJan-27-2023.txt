All of the doctors at a hospital use wireless thin clients to access patient records while performing the daily tasks of diagnosing and treating patients.  The clients use application layer encryption that is integrated into the thin client software, but no layer-2 encryption is used on the WLAN.  Which type of attack is prevented in this configuration?
a:RF jamming|b:Eavesdropping|c:Session hijacking|d:Layer-2 bit-flipping|x:I don't know

A Layer 2 bit-flipping attack targets WEP or other layer 2 encryption for the purpose of modifying in-transit data frames. To prevent this type of attack, a strong Message Integrity Check (MIC) should be used at layer 2. No encryption is in use at layer 2 in this scenario, so this attack is not prevented.When using application layer (layer 7) encryption, all data formats (frames, packets, etc.) underneath are unencrypted. The application itself is what holds the valuable information, so encrypting at layer 7 protects the system from eavesdropping. The application layer encryption will effectively encrypt the mouse movements and screen updates generated by the then client software.RF jamming attacks can only be prevented by physical security, not by any means of encryption. Hijacking attacks may cause the clients to move to rogue software access points, and are not prevented by layer 7 encryption, but rather by authentication protocols supporting mutual authentication, such as 802.1X/PEAP.
