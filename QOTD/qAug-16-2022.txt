There are three logical components involved in Wi-Fi Protected Setup: the Registrar, the AP, and the Enrollee. In some cases these logical components may be co-located (e.g. an AP may include a built-in Registrar).The Enrollee is a Device seeking to join a WLAN Domain. Once an Enrollee obtains a valid credential, it becomes a Member.The Registrar is an entity with the authority to issue and revoke Domain Credentials. A Registrar maybe integrated into an AP, or it may be separate from the AP. A Registrar may not have WLANcapability. A given Domain may have multiple Registrars.The AP is an infrastructure-mode 802.11 access point.A Device is an independent physical or logical entity capable of communicating with other Devicesacross a LAN or WLAN. A Domain is a set of one or more Devices governed by a common authority for the purpose of gaining access to one or more WLANs. A Member is a WLAN Device possessing Domain credentials.
