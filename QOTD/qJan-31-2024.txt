When using a protocol analyzer to troubleshoot an 802.11g network, you occasionally see CF-Poll and CF-ACK frames.  Knowing that these frames are used in PCF mode, what would explain the presence of these frames?
a:These frames are likely corrupted and the protocol analyzer is misinterpreting the frames.|b:Even if PCF-mode client stations are not present, the AP must still begin (Poll) and end (Ack) the contention free (CF) period.|c:The protocol analyzer is configured for PCF mode instead of the more popular DCF mode.|d:CF-Poll and CF-ACK frames are used in PCF as well as in WMM Power Save to announce that the AP has buffered data to transmit.|e:When 802.11b client stations associate with an 802.11g BSS, the AP enables PCF mode as a protection mechanism.|x:I don't know

WLANs regularly experience collisions and interference, which corrupts the reception of 802.11 frames. Protocol analyzers label or flag frames that are received with CRC errors, indicating corrupt reception. Analyzers can be configured to hide all corrupted frames as well, to prevent misinterpretation by the user. Analyzers always try to interpret the frame type being received, even when the CRC fails. These frame fragments may be misinterpreted as frame types that are only used in PCF mode, such as CF-Poll frames. The term CRC refers to “Cyclic Redundancy Check”. This is a procedure whereby a mathematical operation is performed on the contents of the 802.11 frame. A value is produced which is inserted in the FCS (Frame Check Sequence) field of the MAC header. The PHY header also contains a CRC that is calculated against the contents of the PHY header.
