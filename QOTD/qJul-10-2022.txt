ABC Corporation has hired you to review their wireless network security design.  Part of the design allows for clients to establish a secure wireless VPN connection with the corporate network from local Wi-Fi hotspots.  ABC Corporation is considering L2TP as the tunneling protocol.  Why will L2TP alone NOT fit this particular security configuration?
a:L2TP does not natively implement encryption.  Tunneled traffic is still susceptible to eavesdropping.|b:L2TP will not work over 802.11 networks because of address translation requirements.|c:L2TP builds a non-IP tunnel between source and destination.  Non-IP tunnels cannot be routed over the Internet.|d:L2TP implements native encryption using the RC4 stream cipher.  RC4's strength is not adequate to secure traffic traversing the Internet.|x:I don't know

L2TP needs IPSec to protect the tunnel as stated in the standard: 9.2 Packet Level Security Securing L2TP requires that the underlying transport make available encryption, integrity, and authentication services for all L2TP traffic. 802.11 at layer 2 has nothing to do with address translation at layer 3. L2TP uses IP and does not support encryption by itself.
