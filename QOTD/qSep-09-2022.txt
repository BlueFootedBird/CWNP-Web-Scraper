Users have discovered that they are unable to walk between buildings on their campus using the company issued Wi-Fi phones. Both buildings use the same wireless profile configurations in the APs. What most likely went wrong with this deployment?
a:The phones are simply incompatible with the WLAN|b:The company issued phones are using the wrong power settings|c:The buildings are using different SSIDs|d:There was no survey conducted for outdoor use|x:I don't know

An improperly conducted or missing survey will lead to many WLAN problems. It is common practice to provide coverage between buildings for roaming users, especially when they are using Wi-Fi phones. In this case, apparently, outdoor coverage was not designed into the deployment. Because the buildings use the same WLAN profiles, the same SSIDs should be in use in both buildings. In many cases, output power settings on mobile VoIP handsets are not exposed for configuration, so this is not the likely problem. If the phones were incompatible with the WLAN, they could not connect in the buildings either.
