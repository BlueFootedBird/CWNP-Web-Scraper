Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a legacy authentication protocol that transmits a username and password over a network to be compared to a table of name-password pairs. The main weakness of PAP is that both the username and password are transmitted in clear text (unencrypted) which can be captured by a protocol analyzer.
