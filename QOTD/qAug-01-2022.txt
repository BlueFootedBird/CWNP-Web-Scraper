Static WEP keys are the most simple, cost-effective method of securing Ad Hoc (peer-to-peer) wireless networks, but they are also the most vulnerable to attack. Since no authentication server is available, 802.1X/EAP solutions, such as WPA-Enterprise, are not configurable for Ad Hoc networks. PPTP and SSH2 VPN solutions require a server piece, whereas IPSec can work in a peer-to-peer environment. ESP is the IPSec sub-protocol that encapsulates and encrypts the data. WPA2-Personal uses a simple pass-phrase for security, and in that capacity is configurable in much the same way as WEP without the weak security.
