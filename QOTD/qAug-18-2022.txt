Bill, a WLAN end user at ABC Company, is transferring a file over the 802.11g network to a server.  Approximately half way through the transfer, the transfer suddenly stops.  Doing his own initial troubleshooting, Bill finds that his wireless connection is still active, but he can no longer access the corporate network resources.  Confused, Bill calls the help desk who asks him to check his IP address.  Upon checking the IP address of Bill's laptop, they find that his IP address is on the wrong subnet.  The subnet on which Bill's PC is addressed is not part of the corporate network.  The help desk technician informs Bill that he has been subject to what kind of wireless attack?

Wireless L2/L3 hijacking attacks use a narrowband RF generator to jam (interfere with) a specific transmission channel forcing users to roam to another, more usable, channel. This usable channel is the software access point of the intruder. When the authorized user makes an association to the intruder's software AP, this is deemed a L2 hijack. Many operating systems such as Windows 2000 and Windows XP automatically perform a DHCP renewal any time they lose Layer 2 connectivity. For this reason, the intruder can install DHCP server software on the same laptop in order to give the authorized user an IP address when one is requested. This is deemed a Layer 3 hijack. The reason for the Layer 3 hijack is that once the authorized user has an IP address on the same network segment as the intruder, the intruder will be able to perform Layer 7 (application layer) attacks against the authorized user's computer.
