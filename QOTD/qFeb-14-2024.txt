Your WLAN uses WPA2-Personal for security. An employee has recently left the company and knows the passphrase. How could the ex-employee intrude upon your WLAN with this information? (Choose 3)
a:He can enter the passphrase into a protocol analyzer, capture a 4-way handshake, and then decode encrypted traffic in real-time.|b:He can enter the passphrase into an 802.11 frame generator utility and perform a deauthentication attack.|c:He can enter the passphrase into his wireless client utilities and access the network infrastructure.|d:He can enter the passphrase into a rogue software access point and hijack client stations.|x:I don't know

By entering a WPA/WPA2/802.11i passphrase into a protocol analyzer, the protocol analyzer can decrypt another user's session once it sees that user's 4-way handshake. Capturing of the Anonce and Snonce that are part of the 4-Way EAPoL key handshake is required in this scenario, but is very simple to accomplish. If the hacker has the passphrase, his computer can be configured with the passphrase in order to access the network infrastructure just like any other authorized user. The hacker can enter the passphrase into a software access point operating on a laptop or desktop computer, and perform a hijacking attack against client stations in this area. Hijacking is performed using a narrowband jamming device, a software access point, and DHCP server software. Hijacking attacks can pose a denial of service problem, and without a personal firewall in place on the authorized user's laptop, it can also present an information theft problem. By joining the network infrastructure by entering the passphrase into his client utilities, the hacker may also have direct access to other client stations in the ESS. Direct attacks on client stations can be mitigated with a properly implemented personal firewall on each client station.
