Given:  You currently have a wireless network with several legacy clients that only support WEP encryption.As part of your new wireless security policy, all wireless clients are to be secured using an RSN solution whenever possible.  You've added a WLAN controller and must now decide how to configure it to comply with your new wireless security policy.In order to comply with the security policy, how should you configure the WLAN controller?
a:Create two WLAN profiles, one for WEP and one using an RSN solution.  Configure all RSN-capable clients to connect only to the RSN profile, and all WEP-only clients to connect only to the WEP profile.|b:Create a TSN on the WLAN controller that allows connection of both WEP-only and RSN-capable clients.  Replace the WEP-only clients as soon as possible and convert the TSN to an RSN.|c:After creating a WLAN profile on the WLAN controller, create an RSN-tunnel connection for the legacy clients to securely encapsulate the WEP traffic.|d:Configure the WLAN controller with both a TSN and RSN profile.  Create an RBAC policy that routes the RSN traffic through the RSN profile and the WEP traffic through the TSN profile.|x:I don't know
a
RSN networks do not allow for WEP connections, so to comply with your wireless security policy, you must segregate the legacy WEP-only connections from those capable of RSN connections.Most WLAN controllers have the ability to support multiple virtual wireless LANs using the same physical wireless devices. Placing the RSN-capable devices on one WLAN and the WEP-only devices on another WLAN would successfully meet the wireless security policy requirements.
