Given: The exhibit shows a simplified network diagram to demonstrate the WPA2-Enterprise 802.1X setup for this network. Select the true statement.
a:The RADIUS server encapsulates the key in an EAP message that is encrypted with the RADIUS shared secret and sends it to the WLAN client through the AP. The RADIUS shared secret should always be a maximum length, mixed alphanumeric password.|b:The client derives the MSK/PMK during the EAP exchange and the same key is derived by the RADIUS server and passed to the WLAN controller or AP (802.1X authenticator). The supported EAP types should provide mutual authentication, a strong authentication factor(s), and it should export dynamic encryption keys.|c:The AP receives the MSK/PMK from the RADIUS server and then passes the key to the client after encrypting it with standards-based Wi-Fi encryption. AES-CCMP should always be used to ensure that the MSK/PMK is not compromised during transit.|d:The client calculates the MSK/PMK based on input material received from the AP during the 4-way handshake, so the key is never passed over the wireless network. The keys configured on the AP should always be dynamic and at least 128 bits in length.|x:I don't know

In this 802.1X/EAP architecture, the primary concern is ensuring that the EAP authentication method is secure. The MSK/PMK is never passed from the authentication server (AS) to the client. Instead, the AS and client mutually derive the same master keys at some point during the EAP exchange so they are never passed over the wireless medium. The AS passes the master keying material to the authenticator (the WLAN controller or AP) so that the authenticator and the client can then create dynamic encryption keys for the session by means of the 4-way handshake.
