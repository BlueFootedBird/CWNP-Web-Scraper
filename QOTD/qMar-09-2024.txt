What are two general types of IEEE 802.11 Active RFID asset tags?
a:Those that communicate using TCP handshakes|b:Those that communicate via proprietary layer-2 multicasts|c:Those that function as a full, associated WLAN client|d:Those that transmit a continuous stream of 802.11 Beacons|e:Those that use only RTS/CTS as a positioning mechanism|f:Those that use 802.11n sounding PPDUs for channel calibration|g:Those that communicate via layer-2 unicast when interrogated by the AP|x:I don't know

There are two primary types of RFID tag used on the WLAN. RFID tags that interact directly with the WLAN infrastructure (instead of having their data transmitted via a tag reader on the WLAN) are active tags that either associate to the WLAN or use proprietary L2 multicast extensions. Both product types are common, though the former method requires more battery life to initiate and sustain an association whereas the latter method requires less protocol overhead, though it does require proprietary feature support. Many vendor design guides and documentation sets address the different types of RFID tags, including this one from Cisco: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/WiFiLBS-DG.html
