What would be the most effective method by which an attacker could hide a rogue AP from detection by a WIPS system that is configured and calibrated for RF fingerprinting?
a:Configure the SSID to match the existing WLAN|b:Use a 900MHz access point|c:Use high gain antennas with small beamwidths|d:Configure for very low power levels (5 mW or less)|e:Spoof the MAC address|x:I don't know
b
Rogue access points are most commonly installed by legitimate users that want the benefits of a wireless network. These are typically easy to locate, even without sophisticated solutions such as wireless intrusion prevention systems (WIPS). When an attacker installs a rogue access point, they will take as many steps as possible to hide it for as long as possible.Nearly every WIPS solution scans the 2.4 and 5 GHz unlicensed bands, but very few WIPS vendors are currently supporting rogue detection in the 900 MHz band. In addition, 900 MHz access points and WLAN client devices are still available for use by attackers.
