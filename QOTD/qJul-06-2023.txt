a:An RSN must support the CCMP cipher suite, may optionally allow use of the TKIP cipher suite, and may not allow the use of WEP.|b:An RSN must support the CCMP cipher suite, may optionally allow use of the TKIP cipher suite or WEP.|c:An RSN must support the CCMP cipher suite and the TKIP cipher suite, and may not allow the use of WEP.|d:An RSN must support the CCMP cipher suite and the TKIP cipher suite, and may optionally allow the use of WEP.|e:An RSN must support the CCMP cipher suite, may not allow use of the TKIP cipher suite or WEP.|x:I don't know

A Robust Security Network (RSN) is a security network that allows only the creation of robust security network associations (RSNAs). An RSN can be identified by the indication in the RSN Information Element (IE) of Beacon frames that the group cipher suite specified is not wired equivalent privacy (WEP). An RSN must support the CCMP cipher suite, may optionally allow use of the TKIP cipher suite.
