After the initial WIPS installation, what task should be performed before relying on the WIPS in a production environment?
a:Sensors should be calibrated to assure accurate identification of 802.11 frame formats.|b:A single client device should be carried around the perimeter of the installation to verify that it can be heard by a sensor everywhere it roams.|c:Measure sensors' category 5 cable runs to verify they do not exceed 100 meters.|d:A baseline analysis should be performed to aid in locating and categorizing authorized and external access points.|x:I don't know
d
Wi-Fi access points are everywhere. WIPS have great antennas that can hear every access point within a significant range. The WIPS must be trained to understand the difference between an authorized access point (one that is connected to your network) and one that is not connected to your network (external). Authorized access points should adhere to a security policy, while external access points should be monitored so that authorized client devices do not accidentally connect to them. By categorizing authorized and external access points during the initial installation, rogue access points can be easily identified.
