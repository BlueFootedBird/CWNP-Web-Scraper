In an indoor, carpeted office environment, when mounting a PoE-powered AP in a drop ceiling, what should be true?
a:The AP should be installed in a NEMA enclosure|b:The AP should be plenum rated|c:The AP should be installed within 20 feet of an electrical outlet|d:The AP should be 802.11h certified|e:The AP should be near (less than 100 feet) the Ethernet switch|f:The mounting area should be large enough for the AP and the fiber components to power the transceiver.|g:The AP must be properly grounded to the building’s ground system.|x:I don't know

A Plenum space is an area from which air conditioning returns draw air. In most buildings, the area above a drop ceiling or under a raised floor is used as the air return for the HVA Drop ceilings and raised floors are also where Ethernet wiring is often installed. If cabling is installed in a drop ceiling or raised floor, it is out of sight, which means that people would not know if it were burning. When cable that is not plenum rated burns, it emits toxic fumes. These fumes would be fed to the rest of the building through the HVAC system, and as a result, people could be in danger. When APs are mounted in these areas, both the cabling and the AP must be plenum rated, in accordance with most building codes. Plenum rated APs burn without emitting toxic fumes.
