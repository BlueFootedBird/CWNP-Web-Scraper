a:WLAN client utilities must be manually configured with the proper SSID before the client device can connect to an AP.|b:Each radio in an access point can have only one SSID assigned to it.|c:The SSID is a user-defined value that is added to the preshared key to yield the WEP key.|d:SSIDs have a maximum length of 32 bytes, and are case sensitive.|e:Many access points can set the SSID field in Beacon frames to a null value.|f:The SSID is a 6-byte hexadecimal address, used to uniquely identify each AP in a WLAN.|x:I don't know

“Hiding” the SSID of a WLAN--by removing the SSID from beacons and preventing the AP from responding to null probe requests--is a relatively common practice that was originally thought of as a security mechanism to prevent intruders from learning about a network. Though this is not an effective security practice, some administrators still use it for this purpose. Others disable the SSID from beacons to prevent confusion when end-users attempt to connect to the wrong network. There are several methods by which an intruder could determine the SSID of a network. One method simply requires observing (with a protocol analyzer) when a client STA associates with the AP. In the association request frame, one field is reserved for the SSID of the AP. The SSID is a maximum of 32 bytes and is case-sensitive.
