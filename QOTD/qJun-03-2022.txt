Two 2.4 GHz HT APs are co-located in a small multi-tenant office building; one belongs to the neighboring tenants and one belongs to your company.  The neighbor AP is configured with a 20/40 MHz channel, using 1 as the primary channel and 5 as the secondary channel.  Based on best practices for 802.11n deployment, in what way should your 2.4 GHz HT AP be configured in order to avoid interference with the neighbor’s AP, while maximizing throughput?
a:A 20/40 MHz channel should be used with channel 6 as primary and channel 1 as secondary.|b:A 20/40 MHz channel should be used with channel 11 as primary and channel 7 as secondary.|c:A 20/40 MHz channel should be used with channel 7 as primary and channel 11 as secondary.|d:A 20 MHz channel should be used with the AP configured on channel 11.|e:A 20 MHz channel should be used with the AP configured on channel 1.|x:I don't know

802.11n channel bonding improves the available bandwidth for wireless devices by using two adjacent 20 MHz channels, essentially combining them into a single, wide channel. WLAN best practices recommend avoiding channel bonding in the 2.4 GHz band due to the limited number of available channels and the likelihood of experiencing interference from other devices. Because a bonded channel doubles the frequency space required for a transmission, two APs with bonded channels cannot be used in the 2.4 GHz band without experiencing co-channel or adjacent-channel interference. If two APs were deployed in the same area, best practices would be to use only 20 MHz channels on each AP. There are no “combinations” of channel numbers in the 2.4 GHz band that would allow for the simultaneous co-existence of two, 40 MHz systems without degradation.Where maximum throughput is desired, it is recommended to deploy the WLAN using 5 GHz frequencies.
