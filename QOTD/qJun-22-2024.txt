You are intending to use EAP-FAST on your WLAN. You have Windows clients with no extra download modules installed. When attempting to configure using the internal WLAN supplicant, you cannot locate EAP-FAST in the list of available EAP types. What must you do to enable EAP-FAST on the Windows clients?

The correct answer is Download and install the Cisco supplicant from Microsoft. While the LEAP and EAP-FAST EAP types are not included in Windows clients, you can download a Cisco supplicant from Microsoft that adds support for these EAP types. This is a common scenario with different operating systems. They will frequently lack support for the EAP type you require, but may provide that support through a free download from the operating system vendor or some other source.
