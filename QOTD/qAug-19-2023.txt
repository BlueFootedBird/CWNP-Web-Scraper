What is typically the most significant limitation to using an integrated wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) compared to an overlay WIPS?
a:Integrated WIPS cannot identify attackers using wireless clients operating in promiscous mode.|b:Integrated WIPS can only access layer 1 and 2 information in a wireless client data stream|c:Integrated WIPS requires dedicated sensors for monitoring wireless activity|d:Integrated WIPS cannot simultaneously process data traffic from wireless clients while also performing security analysis on other channels|e:Integrated WIPS can only scan the same channel being used for client connectivity.|x:I don't know
d
In an integrated WIPS deployment, infrastructure access points are responsible for assessing traffic to identify attacks. This is effective for monitoring the authorized infrastructure network but limits the ability to assess threats on wireless channels and frequencies outside those used by the wireless network.When an access point is responsible for sending and receiving wireless client communications, it is not able to scan other frequencies (channel hop) for attack activity.
