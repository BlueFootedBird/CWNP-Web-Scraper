A company is evaluating the security solution for their existing WLAN. Two of their supported solutions include a PPTP VPN and 802.1X/LEAP. They have used PPTP VPNs because of their wide support in server and desktop operating systems based on Microsoft Windows. While both PPTP and LEAP adhere to the minimum requirements of the corporate security policy, some individuals have raised concerns that MS-CHAPv2 has proven vulnerable when implemented improperly.
As a consultant, what do you tell the company about implementing MS-CHAPv2 authentication? (Choose 2)
a:WPA2-Enterprise does not support EAP types that use MS-CHAPv2.|b:MS-CHAPv2 may be attacked using offline dictionary attacks.|c:LEAP should be used only if Shared Key authentication is used.|d:MS-CHAPv2 can be used safely within a TLS tunnel.|x:I don't know
b
When properly implemented within a secure tunnel, MS-CHAPv2 poses no security issues; however, if not used within such a tunnel, it will be vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks that can retrieve passwords very quickly. For this reason, MS-CHAPv2 should only be used within a properly implemented tunnel using mutual authentication of the server and the client.
