What is a common reason the location-based identification service found in a typical wireless intrusion prevention system might fail to correctly estimate the location of a transmitter?
a:Transmitter is operating in promiscuous mode|b:Transmitter is changing channels dynamically|c:Transmitter is using a MAC spoofing attack|d:Transmitter is using a physical-layer flood attack|e:Transmitter is performing a layer 2 DoS attack|x:I don't know
c
Most WIPS offer some sort of location-based identification service that are commonly implemented by examining the RSSI of frames based on the source MAC address and triangulating the information with data from other sensors to estimate the location of the transmitter. This works well to identify rogue access points, but is not reliable when an attacker uses MAC spoofing.In a MAC spoofing attack, the attacker will transmit malformed frames into the network by impersonating a valid station or access point. This is problematic for location reporting algorithms, since the algorithm is unable to differentiate legitimate and illegitimate RSSI values for the same source MAC address.
