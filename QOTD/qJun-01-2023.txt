Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a certification designed by the Wi-Fi Alliance that addresses security solutions for IEEE 802.11 WLAN devices. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is legacy 802.11 security. Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) is a certification for IEEE 802.11 QoS (based on 802.11e), and 802.1X/EAP is based on two Requests For Comment (RFCs) and is used for enterprise-class security solutions.
