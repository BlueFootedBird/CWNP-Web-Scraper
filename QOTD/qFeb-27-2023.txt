The only type of security vulnerability that is unique to 802.11 WLANs in this list is transmission medium jamming. Attackers can use RF jammers to perform denial of service (DoS) or hijacking attacks. These attacks are performed against the physical carrier sense mechanism of an 802.11 station. It should be noted however, that the vast majority of problems at the RF layer are due to interference, rather than deliberate attacks.An additional medium jamming tool is an 802.11 frame generator tool. These tools can customize 802.11 frames, and then transmit them to any destination on the shared medium at a desired rate. For example, a broadcast data frame could be configured with the MAC duration field value set to 30ms and subsequently transmitted every 20ms. This would cause the RF medium to halt due to the virtual carrier sense mechanism's normal operation in a BSS.
