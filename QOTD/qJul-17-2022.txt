The primary goal of Wi-Fi Protected Setup is to simplify the security setup and management of Wi-Fi networks. The goal of this specification is to provide users with the assurance that their wireless networks are protected against unauthorized access and disclosure of private information.Examples of WPS Core Architecture include a Discovery Protocol, NFC Interface, and Registration Protocol.The Discovery Protocol is a protocol informing the Enrollee and the Registrar of each other's presence and capabilities. The NFC interface is a contactless interface compliant to the NFC specification, and the Registration Protocol is a (logically) three party in-band protocol to assign a Credential to the Enrollee. The protocol operates between the Enrollee and the Registrar and may receive support through a proxy.
