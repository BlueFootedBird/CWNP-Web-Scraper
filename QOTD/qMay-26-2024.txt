The 802.11-2007 standard, Section 9.8 states:“The PHY of a WLAN is subject to regulations that can vary significantly from one regulatory domain to another. This clause provides the framework for operation across regulatory domains and describes the mechanism that supports cross-domain mobility and operation in multiple regulatory domains.''The method for configuring individual STAs is outside the scope of this standard. A STA must be properly configured for operation in a particular regulatory domain prior to beginning normal operation.'The standard also adds this note in section 9.8: 'This clause does not eliminate the need to obtain type acceptance, regulatory approval, equipment authorization, or equipment certification in each of the regulatory domains in which the equipment will operate. The mechanisms described in this clause provide the information to the STA to identify the regulatory domain in which it is located and to cease operation while in those domains for which it does not have type approval. It is incumbent upon the implementer to provide proof of compliance to the requirements of individual regulatory agencies.”Annexes I and J of the 802.11-2007 specification provide additional details relevant to the operation of WLANs according to regulatory domains. Due to the fact that 802.11 networks operate in unlicensed bands, it is important to note that just because regulations are in place to restrict output power values and frequencies, this does not guarantee an interference-free network.
