The 802.11-2007 standard specifies use of preauthentication over the distribution system (typically Ethernet) and/or the wireless medium. Preauthentication allows clients to perform an 802.1X/EAP authentication prior to (re)associating with a new access point. When a client is roaming and detects an AP to which it would like to associate, it initiates the 802.1X authentication through the access point to which it is currently associated. When an 802.1X/EAP authentication occurs, a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is created on the supplicant (wireless client device) and authentication server (RADIUS server). The authentication server passes the PMK to the AP where it is stored. The supplicant also stores the PMK. The PMK is used to make Pairwise Transient Keys (PTKs) with which data is encrypted. When a client station roams to a new AP, it may elect to put the PMKID (PMK identifier) in the reassociation frame. If the AP to which the client wishes to reassociate still holds the PMK, then the client and AP may skip 802.1X/EAP authentication and proceed directly to the 4-way handshake. Preauthenticating with nearby APs aids a station in reducing the time spent in the roaming process.
