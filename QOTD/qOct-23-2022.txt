What field in the Beacon frame determines how often a beacon is transmitted from the AP?

The correct answer is Beacon interval. The beacon interval field defines the Time Units (TUs) used to count between beacon transmissions. A single TU is 1024 microseconds and the interval is set to 100, which equals 102.4 milliseconds as the interval. This value may be adjusted if required.
