You've recently purchased a WLAN controller that supports rate limiting.  What benefits may your company gain from implementing this feature?
a:Reduction of network congestion|b:Protection against some layer 2 DoS attacks|c:Increased bandwidth for all wireless users|d:Additional throughput for all wireless users|e:Fewer wireless access points required|x:I don't know

Rate limiting provides the ability for network administrators to control the bandwidth used on a per-role or per-user basis, improving network management and reducing traffic congestion. This leads to more efficient bandwidth utilization. This ability is important for wireless networks that typically have a lower amount of total bandwidth available compared to wired networks. Rate limiting can prevent a small number of users from monopolizing network bandwidth, and may even defeat layer 2 denial of server (DoS) attacks (intentional or unintentional) that occur when a user consumes all of the available bandwidth (e.g. through downloading a large file, etc.)Rate limiting controls the amount of bandwidth available for all users, but does not add additional bandwidth or throughput for all users.
