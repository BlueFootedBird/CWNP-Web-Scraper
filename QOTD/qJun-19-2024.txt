PPDU stands for PLCP Protocol Data Unit. PLCP stands for Physical Layer Convergence Procedure. The PLCP prepares 802.11 frames for transmission and directs the Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sub-layer to transmit signals, change radio channels, receive signals, etc. The 802.11 standard comprises several different physical layers that specify how 802.11 frames are transmitted and received. The 802.11n PPDU formats include: “Non-HT format” packets follow the 802.11a or 11g packet structure, depending upon the operating frequency. This format is mandatory.“HT-mixed format” packets contain a legacy 802.11a/g preamble and PLCP header as well as an 802.11n preamble and PLCP header. The legacy portions of the PPDU are interpretable by 802.11a/g stations, but the rest of the frame is not. This format is mandatory.“HT-greenfield format” packets contain only an 802.11n format preamble and PLCP header. This format is not compatible with 802.11a/g stations. This is an optional PPDU format.
