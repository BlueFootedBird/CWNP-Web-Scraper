You have a protocol analyzer that can capture both 802.11 and 802.3 transmissions.  What might you find in the analysis of a wireless transmission that is not seen in the analysis of a transmission over an Ethernet segment?

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption is only used on wireless networks, and WEP packets will not been seen on the Ethernet side. Ethernet's Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is 1500 bytes, while the same value for WLANs is 2304 bytes (when aggregation is not used). An MTU is the largest packet size (measured in bytes) that a network may transmit. Packets larger than the MTU are fragmented into smaller packets. In practice, IP networks fragment packets larger than 1500 bytes to meet the Ethernet maximum MTU requirements. For this reason, it is rare to see a wireless packet larger than 1500 bytes (with added frame headers).
