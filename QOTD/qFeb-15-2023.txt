ABC Corporation, a software development organization, wishes to test their own LDAP implementation in a live wireless environment. Choose the appropriate way to use LDAP for user authentication in a WLAN environment.
a:A WLAN controller is configured to use LDAP as the EAP type for authentication.|b:The LDAP server queries the RADIUS server to ensure user credentials are accurate.|c:A WLAN authenticator (AP) is configured to use LDAP instead of RADIUS as the authentication server.|d:An access point using PEAPv1/EAP-GTC sends an authentication request to the LDAP server which proxies the request to a TACACS+ server for user credential authentication.|x:I don't know
d
LDAP databases are not authentication servers, though they may hold user information. An LDAP server is a directory server. Many device types can directly interact with an LDAP database such as EWGs, EEGs, APs, and WLAN switches/controllers, etc.; however, the LDAP database does not replace the RADIUS server or the TACACS+ server as the authenticator. If an AP supports direct communications with the LDAP server, it is typically such that the AP is playing the role of the authenticator and authentication server or it is used in some way other then 802.1X standards-based implementation.
