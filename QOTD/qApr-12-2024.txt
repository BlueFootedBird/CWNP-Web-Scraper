Your laptop computer currently has an 802.11a/g Mini-PCI card installed.  You would like to upgrade your laptop to have dual-band 802.11n capability and to utilize MCS rates up to 300 Mbps.  Which interface types can be used for this upgrade?

PCI cards do not fit into laptop computers. USB 1.0 adapters are too slow to support 802.11n data rates, so USB 2.0 must be used. 802.11a/g Mini-PCI cards use two antennas instead of the three required for 802.11n and the Mini-PCI slot does not support the Mini-PCIe format. ExpressCard and CardBus formats are external, insertable card types that will work in most modern laptops; however, most laptops today are not sold with CardBus interfaces. USB 2.0 adapters are most likely to be supported, and the interface is fast enough to support 802.11n throughput.
