As you design your WLAN, you have decided to support 802.11b rates, but do not want to support legacy DSSS data rates. You also want to support 802.11g and 802.11n rates.
What data rate configuration would be recommended to meet these design requirements?
a:5.5 and 11 Mbps as basic rates; 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54, and MCS 0-15 as supported rates.|b:6, 12, 24 Mbps as basic rates; 5.5, 9, 11, 18, 36, 48, 54, and MCS 1-15 as supported rates.|c:2, 5.5 and 11 Mbps as basic rates; 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54, and MCS 1-15 as supported rates.|d:5.5, 6, 11, 12 Mbps as basic rates; 1, 2, 9, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54, and MCS 1-15 as supported rates.|x:I don't know

WLAN configuration of data rates is an important part of controlling device connectivity. There are three options for each data rate: not supported, basic, and supported. Support for all basic rates is required by all devices to join the BSS. According to the criteria, DSSS rates (1 and 2 Mbps) must be disabled, so they are neither basic nor supported. 802.11b, but not DSSS (5.5 and 11 Mbps), must be supported. So, since 802.11b devices don’t support OFDM rates and DSSS rates are to be disabled, only 5.5 and/or 11 Mbps may be supported as basic rates. Only one answer option provides this configuration. The supported rates should include all desired 802.11g and 802.11n rates, such as 6, 9, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54, and MCS 0-15 (or higher, if the AP supports more than two spatial streams).
