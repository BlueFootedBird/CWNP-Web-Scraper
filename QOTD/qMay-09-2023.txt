As a salesperson, you have previously sold 802.11b Wi-Fi equipment and installation services to several customers.  You are planning to follow-up with your customers to discuss a migration strategy to 802.11n.  What 802.11n migration strategy could you discuss with your customers to maximize their investment?
a:Upgrading to 802.11n access points can improve link reliability even with the existing 802.11b client devices.|b:When upgrading to 802.11n access points, 802.11b client devices must also be upgraded in order to actualize any of the benefits of 802.11n.|c:Upgrading the access points to 802.11n will increase the security of 802.11b VoWiFi conversations.|d:If you use WPA2-Personal security, you can upgrade the access points from 802.11b directly to 802.11n without first upgrading to 802.11g.|x:I don't know

The 802.11n amendment provides features such as Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC), Transmit Beamforming (TxBF), Spatial Multiplexing (SM), Space-Time Block Coding (STBC), 40 MHz channels, frame aggregation, block acks, short guard intervals (SGIs), and multiple radio chains to improve link throughput, predictability, resilience, range, and reliability. Because most of these features are available in modern Wi-Fi platforms, migration strategies should be discussed to maximize the investment in new Wi-Fi equipment.The most effective upgrade path would be to update both APs and clients at the same time, but many other upgrade strategies can be helpful. Some 802.11n features can improve link performance even if the client is a legacy client, as described in this question. For example, Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) is a receive-only technology that could improve the APs ability to hear a legacy client. A majority of high impact 802.11n features require mutual support, but still others do not.
