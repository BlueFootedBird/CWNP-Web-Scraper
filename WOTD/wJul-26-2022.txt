WPA-Enterprise and WPA2-Enterprise (WF)
Enterprise Mode operates in a managed mode to meet the rigorous requirements of enterprise security. It leverages the IEEE 802.1X authentication framework which uses an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method with an authentication server to provide strong mutual authentication between the client and authentication server via the access point or WLAN controller. In this mode, each user is assigned a unique key mechanism for access to the WLAN. This affords a high level of individual privacy. For WPA, TKIP/RC4 encryption is used. TKIP employs an encryption cipher that issues encryption keys for each data packet communicated in each session for each user, making the encryption code extremely difficult to break. For WPA2, CCMP/AES encryption is used. CCMP/AES is stronger than TKIP/RC4, thus providing additional network protection; however, CCMP/AES requires more processing power than many legacy WLAN devices provide. A hardware upgrade to more modern equipment is usually required for CCMP/AES support. TKIP uses the RC4 encryption cipher originally used in WEP, typically requiring only a firmware upgrade to most legacy equipment. WPA2 also supports TKIP v2, which is not compatible with the TKIP v1 used by WPA. WPA and WPA2 were developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance based upon the IEEE 802.11i amendment. See also WPA and WPA2.
