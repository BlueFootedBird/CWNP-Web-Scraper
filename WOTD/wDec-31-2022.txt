Split MAC Architecture
the Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN) architecture centralizes WLAN configuration and control on a device called a wireless LAN controller (WLC). This allows the WLAN to operate as an intelligent information network and to support advanced services, unlike the traditional 802.11 WLAN infrastructure, which is built from autonomous, discrete entities. The Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture simplifies operational management by collapsing large numbers of managed endpoints, autonomous APs, into a managed system of WLAN controllers. In this architecture, APs are lightweight, meaning that they cannot act independently of a WLC. The WLC manages the AP configurations and firmware. The APs are ?zero-touch? deployed, and no individual configuration of APs is required. The APs are also lightweight in the sense that they handle only real-time MAC (media access control) functionality, leaving the WLC to process all the non-real-time MAC functionality.
