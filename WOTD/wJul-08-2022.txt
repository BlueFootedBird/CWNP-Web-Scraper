IFFT
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform; a fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its inverse ([____]). The algorithm for [____] is the same as the algorithm for FFT, except for a sign change and a scale factor of n = length(X). As for FFT, the execution time for [____] depends on the length of the transform. It is fastest for powers of two. It is almost as fast for lengths that have only small prime factors. It is typically several times slower for lengths that are prime or which have large prime factors. See also FFT.
