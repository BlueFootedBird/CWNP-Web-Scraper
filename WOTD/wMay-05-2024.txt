AP-specified Maximum Transmit Power (Cisco)
the mechanism for controlling the output power of clients from Cisco Aironet access points. It increases the reliability and performance of the wireless network. With the ability to identify the number of associated clients, cell sizes, and adjacent access point radio signals, the access points can determine the optimum power transmit power required for the clients. The ability to dynamically set client output power during the association process will increase the overall performance of the wireless network and improve WLAN device battery life.
