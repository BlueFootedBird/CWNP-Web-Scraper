IEEE 802.11 standard (as amended) (WF)
refers to the most current IEEE 802.11 standard (currently 802.11-2007) including all ratified amendments, supplements, and corrigenda. Many definitions in this document refer to clauses of the 802.11 standard. For example, DSSS is specified in IEEE 802.11-2007 clause 15 but is often simplified as ?Clause 15?. Amendments are updates (changes) to the standard. Standards bodies like the IEEE often create several amendments to a standard before ?rolling up? the ratified amendments (finalized or approved versions) into a new standard. Corrigenda, or errata, is the correction of a book and is most commonly issued shortly after the original text was published
