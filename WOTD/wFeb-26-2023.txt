Multiple Basic Service Set Identifier (MBSSID) (Cisco)
the goals of MBSSID is to create unique beacon transmissions for each BSSID allowing access points to appear to client devices to be several distinct co-located AP?s or multiple-virtual AP?s. This allows up to 8 MBSSIDs per radio or 16 MBSSIDs per AP (in a dual-radio AP), multiple multicast streams, and support for existing clients with no changes/impact on client devices. See also SSIDL.
