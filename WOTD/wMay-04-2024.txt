Cisco M-Drive Technology (Cisco)
a set of tools to facilitate the transition to 802.11n by helping deliver a scalable, reliable wireless foundation. Cisco M-Drive has three major components. Cisco ClientLink helps get the most from coexisting 802.11a/g equipment. Automated RF management tools help deploy and tune access points. Device and connection management tools help ensure the highest level of performance consistently. Cisco M-Drive technology is fully compatible with all new 802.11n and existing 802.11a/g equipment. In this way it helps facilitate the adoption of 802.11n while extending the useful life of existing 802.11a/g solutions.
