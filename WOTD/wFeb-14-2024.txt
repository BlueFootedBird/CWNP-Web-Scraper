Protection mode
prevents simultaneous transmission by devices using 802.11g and 802.11b (which would result in collisions and retransmissions), but it significantly reduces the throughput of the overall 802.11g wireless network. In protected mode, the access point drops down to 802.11b speeds to alert the 802.11b station that an 802.11g transmission is taking control of the media. [____] is a mechanism of prefixing each OFDM data frame with a RTS/CTS complimentary code keying (CCK) frame sequence. The duration fields of the RTS and CTS frames should allow the IEEE 802.11b node to correctly set its NAV and avoid collisions with the subsequent OFDM frames. IEEE 802.11g APs (ERP) should signal to all associated stations in the BSS to use protection mechanisms (RTS/CTS or CTS-to-Self) when a NonERP (802.11b) STA associates to the AP. If one or more 802.11b STAs are associated in the BSS, the Use_Protection bit will be set to 1 in transmitted ERP Information Elements. The NonERP_Present bit shall be set to 1 when a NonERP STA is associated with the BSS. If a STA or AP hears a beacon that supports data rates of 11, 5.5, 2, and 1 Mbps sent by a nearby AP or a STA that is part of an IBSS, it may enable the NonERP_Present bit that triggers protection within a BSS by instructing the AP that hears it in the ERP Information Element of a Beacon to enable the Use_Protection bit. To summarize: 1) If a NonERP STA associates to an ERP AP, the ERP AP will enable the NonERP_Present bit in its own Beacons, enabling protection mechanisms in its BSS. 2) If an ERP AP hears a Beacon with an 802.11b or 802.11 supported data rate from another AP or an IBSS STA it will enable the NonERP_Present bit in its own Beacons, enabling protection mechanisms in its BSS. Thus the presence of an 802.11b station within range of an 802.11g access point forces the access point to invoke RTS/CTS (Request to Send/Clear to Send) or CTS-to-self protection mechanism. See also Protection mechanism, CTS-to-self, and RTS/CTS.
