MAC
Media Access Control; the [____] protocol sub-layer is a part of the Data Link layer (Layer 2) specified in the OSI model. It provides addressing and channel access control mechanisms that make it possible for several terminals or network nodes to communicate within a multipoint network such as a LAN or MAN. The [____] sub-layer acts as an interface between the Logical Link Control sublayer and the network's physical layer (PHY). The [____] layer provides an addressing mechanism called the physical address or [____] address. This is a unique serial number assigned to each network adapter, making it possible to deliver data packets to a destination within a subnetwork.
