HTC (11n)
High Throughput Control; a frame that contains the HT Control field, including the Control Wrapper frame, is referred to as a +HTC frame. The HT Control Field is always present in a Control Wrapper frame, and is present in QoS Data and Management frames as determined by the Order bit of the Frame Control Field. The only Control frame subtype for which HT control field is present is the Control Wrapper frame. A control frame that is described as +HTC (e.g., RTS+HTC, CTS+HTC, BA+HTC or BAR+HTC) implies the use of the Control Wrapper frame to carry that control frame. AKA: HT Control.
