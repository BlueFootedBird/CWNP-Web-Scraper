ASEL (11n)
Antenna Selection; a time-variant mapping of the signals at the RF chains onto a set of antenna elements, when the number of RF chains is smaller than the number of antenna elements at a STA and/or AP. The mapping can be chosen based on instantaneous or averaged channel state information. Antenna selection requires the training of the full size channel associated with all antenna elements, which is obtained by transmitting or receiving sounding PPDUs over all antennas. These sounding PPDUs should be sent within a single TXOP. To avoid channel distortions, these sounding PPDUs shall be transmitted consecutively. The training information is exchanged using the HT control field. When both transmitter and receiver have antenna selection capabilities, training of transmit and receive antennas can be done one after another. Antenna selection supports up to eight antennas and up to four RF chains.
