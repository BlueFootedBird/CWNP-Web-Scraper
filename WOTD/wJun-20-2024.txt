Wi-Fi Alliance (WF)
formerly known as the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA), the Wi-Fi Alliance is a nonprofit international association formed in 1999 to certify interoperability of Wireless Local Area Network products based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and amendments. Wi-Fi Alliance certification programs address Wi-Fi products based on IEEE radio standards (e.g. IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g), wireless network security (WPA, WPA2, and WPS for personal and enterprise deployments), authentication mechanisms used to validate the identity of network devices (EAP), and support for multimedia content over Wi-Fi networks (WMM and WMM-PS).
