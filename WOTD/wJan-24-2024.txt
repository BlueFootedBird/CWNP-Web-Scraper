TSC
TKIP Sequence Counter; TKIP uses a per-MPDU [____] to sequence the MPDUs it sends. The receiver drops MPDUs received out of order, i.e., not received with increasing sequence numbers. This provides replay protection. TKIP encodes the [____] value from the sender to the receiver as a WEP IV and extended IV. TKIP also uses a cryptographic mixing function to combine a temporal key, the TA, and the [____] into the WEP seed. The receiver recovers the [____] from a received MPDU and utilizes the mixing function to compute the same WEP seed needed to correctly decrypt the MPDU. The key mixing function is designed to defeat weak-key attacks against the WEP key.
