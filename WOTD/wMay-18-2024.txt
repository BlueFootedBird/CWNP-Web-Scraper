VSWR
Voltage Standing Wave Ratio; a reflected signal caused by an impedance mismatch between devices (i.e., connectors, cables, Access Points) in an RF system. [____] is the ratio of the maximum voltage to the minimum voltage in a standing wave pattern. A standing wave is developed when power is reflected from a load. So the [____] is a measure of how much power is delivered to a device as opposed to the amount of power that is reflected from the device. If the source and load impedance are the same, the [____] is 1:1; there is no reflected power. So the [____] is also a measure of how closely the source and load impedance are matched. For most antennas in WLAN, it is a measure of how close the antenna is to a perfect 50 Ohms.
