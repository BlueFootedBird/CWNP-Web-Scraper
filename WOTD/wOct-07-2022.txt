RSNA (WF)
Robust Security Network Association; the type of association used by a pair of stations (STAs) if the procedure to establish authentication or association between them includes the 4-Way Handshake. Note that the existence of an RSNA by a pair of devices does not of itself provide robust security. Robust security is provided when all devices in the network use RSNAs.
