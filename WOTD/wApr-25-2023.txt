EHCC
Extended Hyperbolic Congruence Code; a frequency hopping coding scheme that can be implemented with minimal hardware by optimizing the two processes needed in the synthesis of the code words, i.e., generation of the constituent sine waves, and evaluation of the sequence in which they follow each other-which is defined by a function called the placement operator. The constituent sine waves are generated by characterizing them as phase increments. This enables a simplified hardware implementation with an adder and an accumulator. See also HCC.
