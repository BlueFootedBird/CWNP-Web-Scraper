LAP (BT)
LAN Access Point; a device that connects multiple Bluetooth devices to an Ethernet network. Usually Bluetooth LAPs can handle up to 7 devices simultaneously but it is recommended to only connect up to 3 to achieve optimal performance. The coverage area of Bluetooth LAPs is smaller than Wi-Fi access points primarily due to Bluetooth client power restrictions. While Bluetooth LAPs were specified in the Bluetooth standards, there has been limited availability of these devices mostly because of the proliferation of Wi-Fi devices and their speed advantages over Bluetooth.
