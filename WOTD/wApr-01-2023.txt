PIN (BT)
Personal Identification Number; typically a 4 digit number entered on one or both Bluetooth devices for pairing purposes. Often one device has a fixed PIN, such as a wireless headset, so only the PIN on the non-fixed device (e.g., a cell phone) must be entered. During pairing, an initialization key or master key is generated, using the E22 algorithm. The E0 stream cipher is used for encrypting packets, granting confidentiality and is based on a shared cryptographic secret, namely a previously generated link key or master key. Those keys, used for subsequent encryption of data sent via the air interface, rely on the Bluetooth PIN.
