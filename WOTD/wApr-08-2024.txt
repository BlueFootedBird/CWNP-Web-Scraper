PKM (WMX)
Privacy and Key Management; provide a secure distribution of keying data from BS to SS as well as enabling BS to enforce conditional access to network services. The PKM protocol uses X.509 digital certificates, RSA public-key algorithm, and a strong encryption algorithm to perform key exchanges between SS and BS using a client/server model. IEEE 802.16 employs two-tier key systems. The PKM protocol first authenticates the SS to the BS, establishing an Authentication Key (AK) via public-key cryptography, then the SS registers to the network, during which the AK is used to secure the exchange of Transport Encryption Keys (TEK).
