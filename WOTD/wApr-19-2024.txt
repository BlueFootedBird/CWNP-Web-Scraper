Polarization
the physical orientation of an antenna, typically vertical or horizontal but there are some antennas that have circular [____] as well. An antenna will generate an electromagnetic wave that varies in time as it travels through space. If a wave traveling ?outward? varies ?up and down? in time with the electric field always in one plane, that wave (or antenna) is said to be linearly polarized (vertically polarized since the variation is up and down rather than side to side). Linear [____] also includes the possibility of the electromagnetic waves traveling ?right to left? (horizontally) as well. If a wave rotates or ?spins? in time as it travels through space, the wave (or antenna) is said to be elliptically polarized. As a special case, if that wave spins out in a circular path, the wave (or antenna) is circularly polarized. This implies that certain antennas are sensitive to particular types of electromagnetic waves. The practical implication of this concept is that antennas with the same [____] provide the best transmission/reception path.
