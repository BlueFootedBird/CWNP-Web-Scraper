CCKM (Cisco)
Cisco Centralized Key Management; Cisco?s mechanism for handling fast roaming by caching user credentials. Using CCKM, authenticated client devices can roam from one access point to another without any perceptible delay during reassociation. An access point on your network provides wireless domain services (WDS) and creates a cache of security credentials for CCKM-enabled client devices on the subnet. The WDS access point's cache of credentials dramatically reduces the time required for reassociation when a CCKM-enabled client device roams to a new access point. See also AP-assisted Roaming.
